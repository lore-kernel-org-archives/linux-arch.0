First of all, dirfd_path_init() part should be in a separate commit.  And I'm
really not happy with the logics in there.  dirfd_path_init() itself is
kinda-sorta reasonable.  It is equivalent to setting the starting point for
relative pathnames + setting ->root for LOOKUP_BENEATH, right?

But the part in path_init() is too bloody convoluted for its own good.  Let me
try to translate:

  point.

Pardon me, but... huh?  The reason for your two calls of dirfd_path_init() is,
AFAICS, the combination of absolute pathname with both LOOKUP_XDEV and
LOOKUP_BENEATH at the same time.  That combination is treated as if the pathname
had been relative.  Note that LOOKUP_BENEATH alone is ignored for absolute ones
(and with a good reason - it's a no-op on path_init() level in that case).

What the hell?  It complicates your code and doesn't seem to provide any benefits
whatsoever -- you could bloody well have passed the relative pathname to start with.

IDGI...  Without that kludge it becomes simply "do as we currently do for absolute
pathnames, call dirfd_path_init() for relative ones".  And I would argue that
taking LOOKUP_BENEATH handling out of dirfd_path_init() into path_init() (relative)
case would be a good idea.

As it is, the logics is very hard to follow.
