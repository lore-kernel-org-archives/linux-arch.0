 "post_handler," if any, that is associated with the kprobe.
 Execution then continues with the instruction following the probepoint.
 
+Changing Execution Path
+-----------------------
+
+Since the kprobes can probe into a running kernel code, it can change
+the register set, including instruction pointer. This operation
+requires maximum attention, such as keeping the stack frame, recovering
+execution path etc. Since it is operated on running kernel and need deep
+knowladge of the archtecture and concurrent computing, you can easily
+shot your foot.
+
+If you change the instruction pointer (and set up other related
+registers) in pre_handler, you must return !0 so that the kprobes
+stops single stepping and just returns to given address.
+This also means post_handler should not be called anymore.
+
+Note that this operation may be harder on some architectures which
+use TOC (Table of Contents) for function call, since you have to
+setup new TOC for your function in your module, and recover old
+one after back from it.
