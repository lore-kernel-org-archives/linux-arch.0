True.  It's also plausible that there will be different lock
contention issues on very large system with vmalloc vs using the page
allocator.

And there's one other issue.  The patchset will considerably increase
the frequency with which vmap gets called, which will make the giant
hole in Chris Metcalf's isolation series more apparent.  But that's
not really a regression -- the problem is pre-existing, and I've
pointed it out a few times before.  Arguably it's even a benefit --
someone will have to *fix* it now :)

Works for me.

If you think it makes sense, I can split out a bunch of the x86 and mm
preparatory patches and, if it reorders cleanly and still works, the
THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK thing.  Those could plausibly go in 4.7.  Would
you like me to see how that goes?  (I'll verify that it builds, that
the 0day bot likes it, and that the final result of the patchset is
exactly identical to what I already sent.)
