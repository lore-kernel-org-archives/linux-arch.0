Where did PT_GNU_PROPERTY come from?  Are there actual docs for it?
Can someone here tell us what the actual semantics of this new ELF
thingy are?  From some searching, it seems like it's kind of an ELF
note but kind of not.  An actual description would be fantastic.

Also, I don't think there's any actual requirement that the upstream
kernel recognize existing CET-enabled RHEL 8 binaries as being
CET-enabled.  I tend to think that RHEL 8 jumped the gun here.  While
the upstream kernel should make some reasonble effort to make sure
that RHEL 8 binaries will continue to run, I don't see why we need to
go out of our way to keep the full set of mitigations available for
binaries that were developed against a non-upstream kernel.

In fact, if we handle the legacy bitmap differently from RHEL 8, we
may *have* to make sure that we don't recognize existing RHEL 8
binaries as CET-enabled.

Sigh.
