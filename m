We don't do anything special around allocations in syscall.
For aio read we do talloc (internal memory allocator) the
return chunk before going into the pthread pread, so I
suppose this could block. Haven't seen this as a reported
problem though. I suppose you can say "well exactly the
same thing is true of fincore()" :-).
