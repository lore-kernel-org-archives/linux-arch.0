Multi-threaded programs have a similar issue (though with Go it's much
worse). If you fork a multi-threaded C program then you can only safely
use AS-Safe glibc functions (those that are safe within a signal
handler). But if you're just doing three syscalls this shouldn't be as
big of a problem as Go where you can't even do said syscalls.

I agree. My diversion to Go was to explain why it was particularly bad
for cri-o/rkt/runc/Docker/etc.

This is quite clever and I'll admit I hadn't thought of this. This
definitely fixes the ".." issue, but as you've said it won't handle
absolute symlinks (which means userspace has the same races that we
currently have even if you assume that you have a container process
already running -- CVE-2018-15664 is one of many examples of this).

(AT_THIS_ROOT using /proc/$container/root would in principle fix all of
the mentioned issues -- but as I said before I'd like to see whether
hardening ".." would be enough to solve the escape problem.)

I just tried it and /proc/self gives you -ENOENT. I believe this is
because it does a check against the pid namespace that the procfs mount
has pinned.
