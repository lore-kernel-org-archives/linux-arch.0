I still need to think about it some more. I doubt it would be
straightforward.  But I am ok with making such a change, if it makes
sense to do so.

Nothing needs to be done to make it continue execution, because regs->ip
will already have the address immediately after the 'int' instruction,
which is where the iret will return.  So fixup_exception() isn't needed.

Instead, along with the aforementioned 'jmp 333f',  you could move the
refcount_error_report() call to outside the fixup_exception() clause:

if (!user_mode(regs)) {
	if (fixup_exception(regs, trapnr))
		return 0;

	if (fixup_bug(regs, trapnr))
		return 0;

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FAST_REFCOUNT) && trapnr == X86_REFCOUNT_VECTOR) {
		refcount_error_report(regs, str);
		return 0;
	}

(For better readability the refcount parts could be moved to a
fixup_refcount() function.)

Or, another way to handle it would be to use a real exception.  One idea
would be to share UD0 with WARN somehow, and handle it with fixup_bug().
At least then, IMO, the error handling code would be closer to where it
belongs, with WARN and BUG.

But stepping back a bit, why is the interrupt/exception even needed?  Is
there a reason why it can't do the stack dump from the context of the
original overflow?  i.e., instead of 'int 0x81', just call the error
handler directly.  Which could then WARN, send the self-signal, update
the refcount to INT_MAX, etc.

Yeah, it would be good to make BUG and WARN flexible enough such that we
don't need these custom errors, so we can get more consistent error
handling behavior.
