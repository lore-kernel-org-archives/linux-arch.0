It's not about what's after #!; it's what we *append* to what's after #!
that is interesting.  Recall how #! works - we turn execve() of something
that starts with e.g. "#!/usr/bin/make -f\n" into execve of /usr/bin/make,
with (/usr/bin/make, -f, name of that file, argv[1]..argv[argc]) as
arguments list.  With make(1) doing opening and reading the file, as it
would for any makefile.  Or /bin/sh opening and reading the script, etc.

Pathname of interpreter is a non-issue (and ELF ones don't go anywhere
near that path anyway).

Yes, it does.  And if procfs is there, this syscall is completely pointless.
The main argument in favour of adding it to the kernel (rather than doing
in userland) has been "but what of the people who don't want procfs mounted
in there?".

Huh?  What are you talking about?  And who the hell cares whether it's
absolute or relative?

Er...  You do realize that if descriptor refers to the same file,
cat <&<that descriptor> will change position of your other descriptor,
right?  BTW, on *BSD /dev/stdin *does* have a dup()-style semantics.
They do it at the price of very convoluted code in their VFS, but that's
how it works there.  And in Plan 9, and (AFAIK) in Solaris...
