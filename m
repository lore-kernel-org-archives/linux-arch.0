Good idea.

The whole point of the HALF_BITS thing is just to kill the gcc "hey your
shift is greater than bitsize of $type" warning, right?

I really like it.  Except for the low/high ordering it is basically
identical to the patch I've mailed.

While hashing out all the issues I've learned alot about arch specific
ABIs.  I can't see possible trouble spots and don't expect vetos from
arch maintainers.

cheers,
