This is no longer true in -mm tree.

But I agree, this is fixable (and in fact I still hope TIF_MEMDIE will die,
at least in its current form).

But I am afraid we can have more users which assume that thread_info can't
go away if you have a reference to task_struct.

And yes, we have a users which rely on RCU, say show_state_filter() which
walks the task under rcu_read_lock() and calls sched_show_task() which prints
task_thread_info(p)->flags.

Yes this is fixable too, but

So perhaps on x86_64 we should move thread_info from thread_union to
task_struct->thread as Andy suggests.


And just in case, even if we move thread_info, of course we will need
to change dump_trace/etc which reads ->stack. Again, show_state_filter()
relies on RCU, proc_pid_stack() on get_task_struct(). They need to pin
task->stack somehow,  but this is clear.

Oleg.
