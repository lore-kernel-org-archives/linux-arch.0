update_cpu_features() currently cannot tell whether it is being
called during early or late secondary boot.  This doesn't
desperately matter for anything it currently does.

However, SVE will need to know here whether the set of available
vector lengths is known or still to be determined when booting a
CPU, so that it can be updated appropriately.

This patch simply moves the sys_caps_initialised stuff to the top
of the file so that it can be used more widely.  There doesn't seem
to be a more obvious place to put it.
