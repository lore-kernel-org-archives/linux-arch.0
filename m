There is some good stuff in there.  If you don't mind I am going to
cherry pick out your unification of struct siginfo and struct compat_siginfo.

There is actually a core problem with doing things that way.  You rely
on having the siginfo union member stored in the high bits of si_code.

I have just fixed that in my tree and replaced using the high bits
with calling the function siginfo_layout.

It has been a significant problem storing the union member differently
in the kernel than in userspace.  It has allowed for some pretty
horrendous gaffs in the archictecures changing the meaning of SI_USER
when specific signals are delivered over.  It has also meant that ptrace
siginfo injection and tg_sigqueueinfo have been broken for some signals
almost since the interface was added.

Without any optimization and just changing the code to be copy_to_user
I am seeing a maybe 2% slowdown.  Given that no one has seemed to care
overly for the performance of signal delivery I suspect an almost
unmeasurable slowdown is a reasonable tradeoff for simpler code.

All of that said your precise copying code appears reasonable and quite
nice so I may adopt it on the compat side.
