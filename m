Minor nit: what do the hwcaps have to do with ELF really?  Can we just
call them "hwcaps"?

I'm not sure of the history here.

This says that features cannot be probed reliably via the (emulated) ID
registers available with HWCAP_CPUID.

So, what use is the ID register emulation?

For each of hwcaps and cpuid, a particular feature may be reported as
present (y), absent (n), or not described at all (x):

hwcap>    x n y
cpuid:
   x      N N Y
   n      N N
   y      Y   Y

I've filled in the straightforward cases, where software may (Y) or must
not (N) use the feature.

In the cases left blank, hwcap and cpuid disagree.

Are we confident that should never be observed -- i.e., it's a kernel
bug if seen?  If so, we can fill Ys in there.  But we need to be clear
about cases where the hwcap doesn't mean exactly the same as the
corresponding CPUID feature.  The hwcap may tell software it can assume
that certain kernel ABI extensions related to that CPU feature are
available for example.

This also affects how HWCAP_CPUID is described below.
