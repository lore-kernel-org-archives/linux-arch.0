Oh, you mean that #!/usr/bin/make -f would turn into /usr/bin/make
/dev/fd/3?  That could be interesting, although I can imagine it
breaking things, especially if /dev/fd/3 isn't set up like that, e.g.
early in boot.

Why does this use case need the dup-style semantics?  Merely opening
the same file should work, right?

But cat <&3 is shell magic; it isn't actually an invocation of
/bin/cat with some special argument that causes it to poke at some fd.
And bash already supports this kind of use case.

I still don't userstand why the BSD behavior is better here.  Also,
this isn't just file *position* -- anything that opens dupfs/N and
uses fcntl with F_SETFL seems likely to cause failures, crashes, or
outright corruption.  And there are file locks, which suddenly have
rather odd semantics.  (Even with the new OFD locks or with BSD locks,
I wonder how many little programs open argv[1], lock the file, do
something, and then exit.  Anything that does that is now leaking a
lock.)

Aside from the general scariness of allowing one process to actually
dup another process's fds, I feel like this is asking for trouble wrt
the various types of file locks.
