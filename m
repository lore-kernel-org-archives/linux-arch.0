One thing that inheritance give us is ability to change available address
space from outside of binary. Both ELF note and prctl() doesn't really
work here.

Running legacy binary with full address space is valuable option.
As well as limiting address space for binary with ELF note or prctl() in
case of breakage in a field.

Sure, we can use personality(2) or invent other interface for this. But to
me rlimit covers both normal and emergency use-cases relatively well.
