To use memory protection keys (pkeys), an application absolutely
needs to be able to set the pkey field in the PTE (obviously has
to be done in-kernel) and make changes to the "rights" register
(using unprivileged instructions).

An application also needs to have an an allocator for the keys
themselves.  If two different parts of an application both want
to protect their data with pkeys, they first need to know which
key to use for their individual purposes.

This set introduces 5 system calls, in 3 logical groups:

1. PTE pkey setting (sys_pkey_mprotect(), patches #1-3)
2. Key allocation (sys_pkey_alloc() / sys_pkey_free(), patch #4)
3. Rights register manipulation (sys_pkey_set/get(), patch #5)

These patches build on top of "core" pkeys support already in the
tip tree.  This set is specifically built on 3055e4444.

I have manpages written for some of these syscalls, and have
submitted them for review to the manpages list.

This set is also available here:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/daveh/x86-pkeys.git pkeys-v028

I've written a set of unit tests for these interfaces, which is
available as the last patch in the series and integrated in to
kselftests.
