Well, the runtime warning comes "later", that does not automatically transform 
into "too late".

These things are relatively rare. Whether the warning is in tooling or runtime (or 
both) is relatively immaterial in that regard: having it in tooling would be nice, 
but it's not fool-proof either: say if tooling leaves an easy backdoor like 
allowing a type cast to supress warnings then it turns into a hard to debug 
problem again.

So I think we need both, starting with the runtime warning which is easy to 
implement and can be merged right away.

But reality is that upstream tooling changes, especially ones involving compiler 
changes move at a glacier's pace in comparison. Based on past experience I am also 
pretty pessimistic: I'm 90% certain that this 'tooling feature' won't be 
implemented in the next 10 years, so I'd like to concentrate on what we can do 
here and now: the runtime warning and recovery without crashing.

If anyone sends patches for that I'll apply them.

Thanks,

	Ingo
