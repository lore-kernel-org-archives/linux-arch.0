Can you clarify this exception a bit?  I'd like to make sure it's not
such a huge exception that it invalidates the whole point of the
patch.  If you open a file for execute, by actually exec()ing it or by
using something like the proposed O_MAYEXEC, and you have
inode_permission to write, do you still end up with FMODE_PATH_WRITE?
The code looks like it does, and this seems like it might be a
mistake.  Is there any way for user code to read out these new file
mode bits?

What are actual examples of uses for this exception?  Breaking
selftests is not, in and of itself, a huge problem.
