We have debated both approaches over several years, but for
most syscalls, we picked the approach described above, for multiple
reasons:

- For any system call that takes a time_t derived argument, we
  already have two implementations (native and compat), so adding a
  third one requires duplicating some code.

- I want to avoid adding an implementation that is not well tested
  if possible, to make it less likely to introduce security holes or
  subtle bugs that we can't fix later without breaking the ABI.
  Using the same implementation for the new 32-bit case that
  we have for the existing 64-bit case means that this code is
  much better exercised, while reusing the compat code for the
  traditional native syscall means it gets exercised by all current
  user space, which makes it more likely to catch bugs early.

- Looking at the end result, I find it more logical to have each
  of the converted syscalls implement the same binary interface
  on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures with the same code,
  and have the old 32-bit implementation be similarly shared.
  This is even more important once we add new architectures
  that don't even provide the 32-bit time_t interfaces and just
  leave out the old entry points.
