Subject: [PATCH 2/8] signal: Drop signals received after a fatal signal has been processed
X-SA-Exim-Version: 4.2.1 (built Sat, 08 Feb 2020 21:53:50 +0000)

In 403bad72b67d ("coredump: only SIGKILL should interrupt the
coredumping task") Oleg modified the kernel to drop all signals that
come in during a coredump except SIGKILL, and suggested that it might
be a good idea to generalize that to other cases after the process has
received a fatal signal.

Semantically it does not make sense to perform any signal delivery
after the process has already been killed.

When a signal is sent while a process is dying today the signal is
placed in the signal queue by __send_signal and a single task of the
process is woken up with signal_wake_up, if there are any tasks that
have not set PF_EXITING.

Take things one step farther and have prepare_signal report that all
signals that come after a process has been killed should be ignored.
While retaining the historical exception of allowing SIGKILL to
interrupt coredumps.

Remove the SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT test from complete_signal, as it is no
longer possible for signal processing to reach complete_signal when
SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT is true.

Update the comment in fs/coredump.c to make it clear coredumps are
special in being able to receive SIGKILL.
