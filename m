Hmm... I'd make it a new prctl() command, since introspection is
somewhat orthogonal to dumpability. Also, dumpability is per-mm, and I
think the introspection flag should be per-thread.

Ah, nice!

(For what it's worth, I'm mostly concerned about read vs write, not
really about execute, since execute really is just another form of
reading in my opinion.)
