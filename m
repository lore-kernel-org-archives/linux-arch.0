That was bad writing for me.  I'd originally written something like "I
believe this should have been visible to userspace all along", but
then added the ()'s.  I meant to say:

 * I think MAP_UNINITIALIZED should have been non-zero in userspace.
 * MAP_UNINITAILIZED was zero in userspace.
 * A zero MAP_UNINITIALIZED does nothing when OR'd in.

This doesn't have MAP_UNINITIALIZED do anything by default, it just
defines the flag the same way on all systems.  I was under the
impression that this just happened if I set MAP_UNINITIALIZED.
Looking at MAP_HUGE_SHIFT it mmap.c, that's definitely why my mmap()
test case ignored the set MAP_UNINITIALIZED on my PC.

I'm going to make this

 #ifndef MAP_UNINITAILIZED
 #define MAP_UNINITAILIZED 0
 #endif

and then leave Xtensa's port alone.  This is what Arnd suggested
originally, sorry for the extra work!

The whole goal here was to eliminate "#ifndef CONFIG_*" from the
user-visible headers.  This all started because I got bit by a very
similar-looking bug (see patch #1), so I'd prefer not to go down that
route.
