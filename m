I took a look at the patches other than the self-tests and the
documentation. I did not see any major problems other than thinking
there is a lot of ways for userspace to shoot itself in the foot and
lose the protection pkeys is meant to give.

That said, consider the review to be unreliable on the grounds I haven't
followed pkeys development and this is my first time looking in its
general direction.
