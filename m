Per definition EWOULDBLOCK seams like a better fit. Like you said
above it won't stop blocking unless you do something. I also did a
search in the kernel source (excluding drivers / sound directories)
use of EAGAIN (even in network code) is like 2 magnitudes bigger then
EWOULDBLOCK. In fact some places that grep found check for both
(although I'm sure it's optimized out).

Does anybody feel strongly about it being EWOULDBLOCK instead of
EAGAIN? Esp. since they are same on Linux? The convention (by numbers)
seams to favor EAGAIN.
