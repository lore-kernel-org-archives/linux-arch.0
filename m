I guess a less artificial test case which would would generate a lot of
tasks and some memory pressure would be more representative (e.g.
kernbench). The thing is that even order-2 pages might get quite
expensive when the memory is fragmented.

I agree, there is a room for improvement but no necessarily as a part o=
