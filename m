From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

The section of memory-barriers.txt that describes the dma_Xmb() barriers
has an incorrect example claiming that a wmb() is required after writing
to coherent memory in order for those writes to be visible to a device
before a subsequent MMIO access using writel() can reach the device.

In fact, this ordering guarantee is provided (at significant cost on some
architectures such as arm and power) by writel, so the wmb() is not
necessary. writel_relaxed exists for cases where this ordering is not
required.

Fix the example and update the text to make this clearer.
