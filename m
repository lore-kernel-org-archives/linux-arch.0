you copied code from a version which is at least 2 major kernel revisions
behind (so much for those apples), you chose the one version which had a
bug that you didn't spot nor fix properly, you didn't realize the opportunity
that a special refcount type represents, you claimed refcount underflows
aren't exploitable but copied code that would detect signed underflow, you
didn't understand the limits and edge cases i explained above... need i go
on? doesn't leave one with great confidence in your ability to understand
and maintain this code...
