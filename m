Thanks, good catch. Will fix. Needs the cast - I'm sure I had it at one 
point, but it got lost..

[ looks around ]

Heh. I had the cast in my original email that wasn't a patch:

        #define HALF_LONG (BITS_IN_LONG / 2)

	offset = (((loff_t)high << HALF_LONG) << HALF_LONG) | low;

but then when I actually turned it into a patch, I had lost it:

	+#define HALF_LONG_BITS (BITS_PER_LONG / 2)
	+       return ((high << HALF_LONG_BITS) << HALF_LONG_BITS) | low;

(but at least I had fixed the "BITS_IN_LONG" to "BITS_PER_LONG").

It was very much deliberate - the high bits disappear, since we don't have 
128-bit loff_t.

And it's not a sneaky trick, it's totally standard programming. We have 
the same thing in a few other places:

	drivers/net/starfire.c: writel( (np->queue_mem_dma >> 16) >> 16, ioaddr + RxDescQHiAddr);

Notice the ">> 16) >> 16" thing? That's a way to write ">> 32" without 
having the undefined overflow in 32 bits - if we have just a 32-bit dma 
address type, it just turns into "high bits are 0".
