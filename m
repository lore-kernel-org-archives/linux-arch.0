I first thought it wouldn't matter for ptrace-based tracers since the
syscall numbers are (mostly) the same. But the arguments layout in
register is indeed different, so I see your point now about having to
distinguish.

The ILP32 state does not change at run-time, so it could only do a
ptrace() call once and save the information. No need to re-read it on
each syscall stop.

We could set a high bit in the syscall number reported to the ptrace
caller (though not changing the syscall ABI) but I haven't thought of
other consequences. For example, can the ptrace caller change the
syscall number?

We tried, see my other reply.
