Right, I think it'll be there just as a debugging assist: something
broke with DEBUG_RODATA, let's boot with rodata=off and see what
happens.

I've looked at the implementation in ARM again, and I think I see how
it can be improved slightly. I think I named things incorrectly when I
implemented, and I'll be sending a patch to fix that up. In the end,
though, I agree: the thing that is CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA may change its
name, but on some architectures, there is a cost to using it, so it
needs to remain a CONFIG.
