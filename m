I apologize for the very late review, but (see other thread) I think
we may need to make sure we've defined the signal delivery semantics
in a useful way before enabling these.  I'm not convinced that the
current behavior is helpful.  This may or may not require any change
to the syscall signatures, but I can imagine that doing it right would
involve adding another syscall to *read* the current signal-delivery
state of a pkey or perhaps of all the pkeys.  That could potentially
be achieved by adding an extra pointer parameter to pkey_get so
pkey_get can return both the current state and the state at next
signal delivery.
