This seems extremely dangerous. I like the overall series, but not this patch.

So now what happens if there is a setuid root ELF binary with program
interpreter "/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2" (like /bin/su), and an
unprivileged user runs it with execveat(..., AT_THIS_ROOT)? Is that
going to let the unprivileged user decide which interpreter the
setuid-root process should use? From a high-level perspective, opening
the interpreter should be controlled by the program that is being
loaded, not by the program that invoked it.


In my opinion, CVE-2019-5736 points out two different problems:

The big problem: The __ptrace_may_access() logic has a special-case
short-circuit for "introspection" that you can't opt out of; this
makes it possible to open things in procfs that are related to the
current process even if the credentials of the process wouldn't permit
accessing another process like it. I think the proper fix to deal with
this would be to add a prctl() flag for "set whether introspection is
allowed for this process", and if userspace has manually un-set that
flag, any introspection special-case logic would be skipped.

An additional problem: /proc/*/exe can be used to open a file for
writing; I think it may have been Andy Lutomirski who pointed out some
time ago that it would be nice if you couldn't use /proc/*/fd/* to
re-open files with more privileges, which is sort of the same thing.
