Fair enough.  That being said:

1. Intel needs to document this crap.  I don't want a situation where
we keep adding random mitigations in the hopes that we got them all.

2. Wny on Earth is MASK_NOSPEC in smap.h?

3. What's with sbb; and?  I can see two sane ways to do this.  One is
cmovaq [something safe], %rax, *in the #ifdef CONFIG_RETPOLINE block*.
(Or is cmov subject to incorrect speculation, too?  And, if cmov is,
why wouldn't sbb be just as bad?  At least using cmov here is two
whole ALU ops shorter.)  The other is andq $(syscall table size), %rax
(again inside the ifdef block) and to round the syscall table to one
less than a power of two.

In my mental model of how a CPU works, the cmov approach makes more
sense, since we're about to jump somewhere that depends on the syscall
nr, and any *the whole point* of the mitigation here is to avoid
jumping anywhere until the CPU has fully caught up with reality wrt
the syscall number.
