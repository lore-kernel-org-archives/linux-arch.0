actually the kernel could silently recover from this given how the
page fault handler could easily determine that the fault address fell
into the data..read_only section and just silently undo the read-only
property, log the event to dmesg and retry the faulting access.

this is exactly what i suggested earlier in the constify thread ;).
note that this will produce false positives because __init* annotations
are not propagated everywhere they could be.

one of our plans for initify is to add the discovery and propagation
of _init* annotations as well, it'd not only fix the false positives
mentioned above but also help reduce the kernel size (code/data/rodata).
