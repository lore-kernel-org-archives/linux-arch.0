We've just been over this for the CET enablement.  ELF PT_NOTE parsing
was rejected there.

I don't think binutils ld has a way to set an ELF program header it
doesn't know anything about.

Are restrictive personality flags still a problem with user namespaces?
I think it would be fine to restrict this one to CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
