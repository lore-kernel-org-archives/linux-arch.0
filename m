It=E2=80=99s worse than that. I have patches to make the vsyscall be execute=
-only. And the slowly forthcoming CET patches will change the machine code.

I didn=E2=80=99t add a flag because the vsyscall page was thoroughly obsolet=
e when all this happened, and I wanted to encourage all new code to just par=
se the vDSO instead of piling on the hacks.

Anyway, you may be the right person to ask: is there some credible way that t=
he kernel could detect new binaries that don=E2=80=99t need vsyscalls?  Mayb=
e a new ELF note on a static binary or on the ELF interpreter? We can dynami=
cally switch it in principle.=
