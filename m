Way back when, I proposed a new flag called MAP_FIXED_WEAK.  I was
dissuaded from it when userspace people said it was just as easy for
them to provide the address hint, then run fixups on their data if the
address they were assigned wasn't the one they asked for.

The real problem is that MAP_FIXED should have been called MAP_FORCE.

So ... do we really have users that want failure instead of success at
a different address?  And if so, is it really a hardship for them to
make a call to unmap on success-at-the-wrong-address?
