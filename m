Busy is not a state of a reference count.

It is true I am suggesting treating something with a saturated reference
as not available.  If that is what you mean by busy.  But if it's
reference is zero it is also not available.  So there is no practical
difference.

Using little words.

A return of true from inc_not_zero means we took a reference.
A return of false means we did not take a reference.

The code already handles I took a reference or I did not take a
reference.

Therefore lying with refcount_t is not helpful.  It takes failures
the code could easily handle and turns them into leaks.

At least that is how I have seen reference counts used.  And those
are definitely the plane obivous semantics.

Your changes are definitely not drop in replacements for atomic_t in my
code.
