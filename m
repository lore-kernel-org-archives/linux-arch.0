Somebody else reported a problem on the upstream patches as well.  Any
chance you can confirm the stacks of the active but not running tasks?

It sounds like they are stuck on a waitqueue, the question is which
one.  I forgot to disable OOM for __GFP_NOFAIL allocations, so they
could succeed and leak an OOM context.  task structs are not
reinitialized between alloc & free so a different task could later try
to oom trylock a memcg that has been freed, fail, and wait
indefinitely on the OOM waitqueue.  There might be a simpler
explanation but I can't think of anything right now.

But the OOM context is definitely being leaked, so please apply the
following for your next reboot:
