I read the only relevant gABI thing I could find easily, and it seems
to document the "gnu property" thing.  I have no problem with that.

I admit that I'm not really clear on exactly what RHEL 8 shipped.
Some of this stuff is very much an ELF ABI that belongs to the
toolchain, but some if it is kernel API.  For example, the IBT legacy
bitmap API is very much in flux, and I don't think anything credible
has been submitted for upstream inclusion.  Does RHEL 8's glibc
attempt to cope with the case where some libraries are CET-compatible
and some are not?  If so, how does this work?  What, if any, services
does the RHEL 8 kernel provide in this direction?
