I think that case was entirely different, but I've Cc:-ed Linus to shoot my idea 
down if it's crap.

We are getting the _same_ information: we generate a reliable stack trace right 
there. We don't ignore anything.

What my suggestion would do is to turn a 'sure system crasher' into a 
'informational debug message'.

On today's typical desktop systems I can tell you with 110% confidence that the 
vast majority of 'system crasher' oopses never reaches a kernel developer's 
attention, because the oops message is not propagated to the user, while the 'dump 
stack trace and try to continue' approach will result in proper bugzillas.

And that's really an important distinction IMHO. Getting debug info out of the 
system is very important - and those who are paranoid can set a Kconfig value to 
crash their systems on any hint of a problem.

That's absolutely true as well but an independent issue: it does not invalidate my 
argument that is based on the status quo, which is that the vast majority 
panics/oopses, _especially_ during suspend/resume that was mentioned in this case, 
does not reach any kernel developer.

Thanks,
