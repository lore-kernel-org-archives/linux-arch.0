FWIW: I think we should be entertaining a prctl() interface to use a new
key on a per-thread basis. Obviously, this would need to be used with care
(e.g. you'd fork(); use the prctl() and then you'd better not return from
the calling function!).

Assuming we want this (Kees -- I was under the impression that everything in
Android would end up with the same key otherwise?), then the question is
do we want:

  - prctl() get/set operations for the key, or
  - prctl() set_random_key operation, or
  - both of the above?

Part of the answer to that may lie in the requirements of CRIU, where I
strongly suspect they need explicit get/set operations, although these
could be gated on CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE=y.
