Yeah, so let's assume we have some pkey-unaware thread.  The upside of a
scheme where the kernel preemptively (and transparently to the thread)
locks down PKRU is that the thread can't go corrupting any non-zero-pkey
structures that came from other threads.

But, the downside is that the thread can not access any non-zero-pkey
structures without taking some kind of action with PKRU.  That obviously
won't happen since the thread is pkeys-unaware to begin with.  Would
that break these libraries unless everything using pkeys knows to only
share pkey=0 data with those threads?

I'm not sure this is possible for PKRU.  Think of a simple PKRU
manipulation in userspace:

	pkru = rdpkru();
	pkru |= PKEY_DENY_ACCESS<<key*2;
	wrpkru(pkru);

If we push a PKRU value into a thread between the rdpkru() and wrpkru(),
we'll lose the content of that "push".  I'm not sure there's any way to
guarantee this with a user-controlled register.
