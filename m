Or can it synthesize them by reusing page table pages that map zeros?

IIRC, we only ever fill single PMDs, even though we could gang a pmd
page up and do it for 1GB areas too.

I guess the page table consumption could really suck if we had code all
over the 57-bit address space and that code moved around and the process
ran for a long long time.  Pathologically, we need a ulong/pmd_t for
each 2MB of address space which is 8*2^56-30=512GB per process.  Yikes.
 Right now, we'd at least detect the memory consumption and OOM-kill the
process(es) eventually.  But, that's not really _this_ patch's problem.
 It's a general problem, and doesn't even require the zero page to be
mapped all over.

Longer-term, I'd much rather see us add some page table reclaim
mechanism that new how to go after things like excessive page tables  in
MAP_NORESERVE areas.
