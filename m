Hmm, this was from your 4.9 port. Linus hasn't quite released 4.11
yet, so that's actually "at most 2 major kernel revisions behind". :)
Regardless, I'd be happy to refresh the port. Will you share a URL to
your latest rebase against upstream?

As I said, I was trying to minimize changes to your implementation,
which included the bug and the other issues. The point of this was to
share it with others, and work collaboratively on it. I think this
clearly succeeded with benefits to both upstream and PaX: Jann spotted
the fix for the bug causing weird crashes I saw when doing initial
testing, you pointed out the benefit of using js over jo, I've
reorganized the RMWcc macros for more easily adding trailing
instructions, Peter is thinking about ways around the protection, etc.

Well, that's your opinion. I think the patch and its discussion helped
several people, including myself, understand this code. Since many
people will share its maintenance, I think this is the right way to
handle upstreaming these kinds of things. I don't claim to be
omniscient, just persistent. Getting this protection into upstream
means every Linux user will benefit from what you created, which I
think is awesome; this whole class of refcount flaws goes away. Thank
you for writing it, sharing it, and discussing it!
