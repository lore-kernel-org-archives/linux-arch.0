that's actually not the typical case in my experience, but rather these two:

1. initial mistake: someone didn't actually check whether the given object can
   be __read_only

2. code evolution: an object that was once written by __init code only (and
   thus proactively subjected to __read_only) gets modified by non-init code
   due to later changes

what you described above is a third case where there's a latent bug to begin
(unintended write) with that __read_only merely exposes but doesn't create
itself, unlike the two cases above (intended writes getting caught by wrong
use of __read_only).

not really, the two cases above are not a priori bugs, they become bugs due
to using __read_only without due care (which is why i suggested to detect
them at compile time).

my proposal would produce the exact same reports, the difference is in letting
the write attempt succeed vs. skipping it. this latter step is what is wrong
since it introduces at least a logic bug the same way the constprop optimization
created a logic bug.

this would/should be the default behaviour, i.e., no attempt at being smart by
either allowing or skipping the faulting insn, just report the event and trigger
whatever fancy future exploit reaction mechanism will get into the kernel.
