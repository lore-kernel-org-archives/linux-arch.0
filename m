What masked pointer?  access_ok() exists for other architectures as well,
and the fewer callers remain outside of arch/*, the better.

Anything that open-codes copy_from_user() that way is *ALREADY* fucked if
it cares about the overhead - recent x86 boxen will have slowdown from
hell on stac()/clac() pairs.  Anything like that on a hot path is already
deep in trouble and needs to be found and fixed.  What drivers would those
be?  We don't have that many __get_user() users left outside of arch/*
anymore...
