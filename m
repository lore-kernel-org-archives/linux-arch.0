Why would it do the copy in the first place if we asked (for example)
for 16k, but only 8k was available ? Just return EAGAIN and have
done with it.

We can do that, but as Volker says this is a very hot code path.

It's been done as a test, so the code exists and has run (and improved
perforamance as I recall). Not much point commiting it without kernel
support :-).

Sounds good to me !
