Hi Michal,

From looking at the patchset, it seems to me that the new MAP_FIXED_SAFE
(or whatever it ends up being named) *would* be passed through from
user space. When you say that "we won't export expose the new semantic 
to the userspace at all", do you mean that glibc won't add it? Or
is there something I'm missing, that prevents that flag from getting
from the syscall, to do_mmap()?

On the usage: there are cases in user space that could probably make
good use of a no-clobber hint to MAP_FIXED. The user space code
that surrounds HMM (speaking loosely there--it's really any user space
code that manages a unified memory address space, across devices)
often ends up using MAP_FIXED, but MAP_FIXED crams several features
into one flag: an exact address, an "atomic" switch to the new mapping,
and unmapping the old mappings. That's pretty overloaded, so being
able to split it up a bit, by removing one of those features, seems
useful.

thanks,
John Hubbard
