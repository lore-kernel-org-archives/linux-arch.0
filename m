( Sidenote: I don't think a ro-faults typically result in triple faults, but yeah, 
  even having a regular oops (followed by a hang or reboot) during such an 
  undebuggable state of the system is a major PITA. )

So a safer method would be to decode the faulting instruction, to skip it by 
fixing up the return RIP and to log the event. It would be mostly equivalent to 
trying to write to ROM (which get ignored as well), so it's a recoverable (and 
debuggable) event.

We have all the necessary code in place in the kprobes code, see 
arch/x86/lib/insn.c, it's a simplified x86 decoder that knows about instruction 
length (but not about semantics).

Simple skipping plus setting arithmetic flags to init value should be enough I 
think: I don't think we use fancy instructions to write to ro variables, such as 
PUSH/POP with other side effects. If such instructions exist we could minimally 
extend the decoder to do those fixups as well - in addition to double checking 
that we skip simple instructions only with no side effects.

Can you see any fragility in such a technique?

Thanks,

	Ingo
