Yes.  There is a silliness in how it implements fexecve.  The fexecve
case should be use the empty string "" not a NULL pointer to indication
that.  That change will then harmonize execveat with the other ...at
system calls and simplify the code and remove a special case.  I believe
using the empty string "" requires implementing the AT_EMPTY_PATH flag.

For sandboxes execveat seems to make a great deal of sense.  I can
get the same functionality by passing in a directory file descriptor
calling fchdir and execve so this should not introduce any new security
holes.  And using the final file descriptor removes a race.

AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW seems to have some limited utility as well, although
for exec I don't know what problems it can solve.

Until I am done moving I won't have time to pick this up, and the code
clearly needs another revision but I will be happy to work to see that
we get a sane execveat implemented.

Eric

p.s.  I don't believe there are any namespaces issues where doing
something with execveat flags make sense.
