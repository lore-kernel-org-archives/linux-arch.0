I guess the point PaX Team (and me earlier in this thread) wanted to
make is that having misuse detection *only* at run-time will make
those kind of bugs visible too late -- as late as on the wrong write
attempt actually happening. It would be much better to have the
compiler complain about invalid write statements already during
compilation, much like it does when one wants to assign some value to
a const object.

Having the page fault handler being able to recover from
__ro_after_init faults is a nice feature to support users, actually
being able to report bugs. But it shouldn't be the only way to detect
those kinds of bugs. In fact, we've tools in our toolchain that try to
detect and flag wrong usage of __init / __exit, so why not cover
__ro_after_init as well? Admitted, that won't be possible with modpost
in its current state, but would require a compiler extension instead.
Its current non-existence shouldn't be a show-stopper for
__ro_after_init but the very next step to take care of before
extending the usage of that annotation.

Just my 2ct,
Mathias
