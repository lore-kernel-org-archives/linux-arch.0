Sorry, I never was involved in that discussion.

Oh well, we really need this kind of attitude right now. We are all fed up
with that mess, but Ingo and I care about the details, consistency and
general code quality beyond the current rush to get stuff solved. It's our
damned job as maintainers.

If you decide you don't care anymore, please let me know, so I can try to
free up some cycles to pick up the stuff from where you decided to dump it.
