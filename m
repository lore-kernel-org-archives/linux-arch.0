I'd personally prefer that we didn't try to guess if a fault is due to a failed
AUT*, even for logging.

Presently, it's not possible to distinguish between a fault resulting from a
failed AUT* and a fault which happens to have hte same bits/clear, so there are
false positives. The architecture may also change the precise details of the
faulting address, and we'd have false negatives in that case.

Given that, I think suggesting that a fault is due to a failed AUT* is liable
to make things more confusing.

Thanks,
Mark.
