Ugh. I was sort of imagining that we would treat supervisor state completely=
 separately from user state.  But can you maybe give examples of exactly wha=
t you mean?

This is FPU, XMM, etc, right?

User CET?

Like supervisor CET?  If we start doing supervisor shadow stack, the context=
 switches will be real fun.  We may need to handle this in asm.

Where does PKRU fit in?  Maybe we can treat it as #3?
