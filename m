  * A newly forked process directly context switches into this address.
  *
  * rdi: prev task we switched from
+ * rsi: task we're switching to
  */
 ENTRY(ret_from_fork)
-    LOCK ; btr $TIF_FORK, TI_flags(%r8)
+    LOCK ; btr $TIF_FORK, TI_flags(%rsi)    /* rsi: this newly forked task */

     call    schedule_tail            /* rdi: 'prev' task parameter */

I think you forgot GET_THREAD_INFO() here.  RSI is the task, not the
thread_info.  FYI, this goes away with my switch_to() rewrite, which
removes TIF_FORK.
