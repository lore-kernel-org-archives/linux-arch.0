However, this distinction between .rodata and .data..ro_after_init is
kind of fuzzy, anyway, since they both get made actually read-only at
the same time (post init).  The patch actually does work fine with the
vDSO page in .rodata, since the patching happens during init.

Is there a possible future consideration to perhaps make .rodata read
only much earlier?
