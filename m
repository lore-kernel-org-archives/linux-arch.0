Are you sure about "wouldn't do anything"?
Suspiciously, 0x4000000 is also (1 << MAP_HUGE_SHIFT). I'm not sure if any
architecture has order-1 huge pages, but still looks like we have conflict
here.

I think it's harmful to expose non-zero MAP_UNINITIALIZED to system which
potentially can handle multiple users. Or non-trivial user space in
general.

Should we leave it at least under '#ifndef CONFIG_MMU'? I don't think it's
possible to have single ABI for MMU and MMU-less systems anyway. And we
can avoid conflict with MAP_HUGE_SHIFT this way.

P.S. MAP_UNINITIALIZED itself looks very broken to me. I probably need dig
mailing list on why it was allowed. 
But that's other topic.
