Actually, we're not expanding any VFS structures with the next
patchset. I've rebased the forthcoming patchset ontop of Al's
vfs/linux-next tree to keep track of the refactoring already done with
some of the code paths I touched. The refactoring work done there
already ads a flag argument to kiocb struct for other reasons.
