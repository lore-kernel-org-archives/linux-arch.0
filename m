As you say signal->group_exit_task, and core_state->dumper.task point to
the same task.  So it may be a little silly when viewed independently of
everything else to use core_state->dumper.task instead of
group_exit_task as it is an extra cache line dereference.

The thing is signal->group_exit_task is only used by coredumps currently
as a flag to tell signal_group_exit to return true.  It is exec that
actually uses signal->group_exit_task in conjunction with
signal->notify_count to wake itself up.

Using a pointer as a flag and not for it's value.  Having different
semantics for who sets the pointer.  All of those are weird enough
I just want to make signal->group_exit_task to go away.

By using core_state->dumper.task I was able to make
signal->group_exit_task exclusive to the exec case in the following
changes, and to rename it signal->group_exec_task so no one gets
confused what the field is for.

Which is the a specific thread of the target process, and it is
the only thread running of the target process.

If you look at zap_threads.  You can observe that it takes the siglock,
sets SIGNAL_GROUP_COREDUMP, and sets signal->core_state and in
zap_process makes SIGKILL pending is the per-task sigset, and calls
signal_wake_up on every task.

This case in prepare_signal happens after that.  After every task
has been told to die, and __fatal_signal_pending is true for all of
them if they have not reached do_exit yet.



If you look in zap_threads you will see that the core dumping thread
clears TIF_SIGPENDING, and in general makes fatal_signal_pending false
for itself.  But keep in mind that this thread because it is dumping
core is already on the path to do_exit.  It has already processed a
fatal signal.


So in the special case I only worry about the dumping task as it is the
only task after zap_threads that does not have fatal_signal_pending.


This is different than the ordinary case of delivering SIGKILL
where complete_signal makes SIGKILL pending in the per-task sigset
of every task in the process.


Currently I suspect changing wait_event_uninterruptible to
wait_event_killable, is causing problems.

Or perhaps there is some reason tasks that have already entered do_exit
need to have fatal_signal_pending set. (The will have
fatal_signal_pending set up until they enter get_signal which calls
do_group_exit which calls do_exit).

Which is why I am trying to reproduce the reported failure so I can get
the kernel to tell me what is going on.  If this is not resolved quickly
I won't send you this change, and I will pull it out of linux-next.

Eric
