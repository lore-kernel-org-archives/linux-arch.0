Given that the architecture doesn't provide an identification mechanism
for the case where only one of the keys is available, I would much prefer
that we expose both of the keys to userspace. Is the only downside of
that a possible exception entry overhead if the kernel wants to use pointer
authentication as well?

Having an initial implementation where the B key operations act as NOPs
isn't ideal if we want to support future users -- chances are they'll
be put off because deployed kernels don't give them whatever security
guarantees they require. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, so
unless we have good reasons to keep the B key hidden, I think we should
be exposing it from the start.
