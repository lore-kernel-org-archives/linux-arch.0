I'm struggling a bit to grok this. Are you referring to the state of
the flags from the address limit comparison? That's the result that
needs fencing before speculative execution leaks to to the user
pointer de-reference.

This 'for free' aspect is what I aiming for.

I'll add a note to the changelog that having the fence after the
'stac' hopefully allows some overlap of the cost of 'stac' and the
flushing of the instruction pipeline.
