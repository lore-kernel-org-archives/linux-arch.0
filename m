I believe, /proc/PID/auxv is enough to distinguish between arm64, ilp32
and aarch32 ABis. If no, I think it's better to do it there.

I don't have ILP32 machine available at the moment, but I'll check it soon.=

A couple of links to recall the story:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-s390/msg11593.html
http://linux-kernel.2935.n7.nabble.com/RFC6-PATCH-v6-00-21-ILP32-for-ARM64-=
td1345105.html

Cover-letter of the series has links to previous discussions.

I would also notice that even if we pass 64-bit parameters in a single
register, we cannot avoid using the compat layer. It looks more natural
not to split the 64-bit register, but from performance point of view
there is almost no difference, either we split registers or not (2.6%
for empty syscall, as I measured). And the cost of overcomplication was
considered too much. So we chose to stick to more standard compat layer
and gain in maintainability.=20
