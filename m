Looks really good to me, thanks. Just a few comments inline.

How about saying:

  In addition, the other bits of arg2 must be set according to the following
  combinations of flags:

Otherwise I find it a bit fiddly to read, because it's valid to have
flags of 0 and a non-zero length.

(implementation note: does this mean that 'sve_default_vl' should be
 an atomic_t, as it can be accessed concurrently? We probably need
 {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() at the very least, as I'm not seeing any locks
 that help us here...)

If I'm reading the kernel code correctly, this is slightly weird, as
the returned value may contain the PR_SVE_VL_INHERIT flag but it will
never contain the PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC flag. Is that right?

If so, maybe just say something like:

  On success, a nonnegative value is returned that describes the selected
  configuration in the same way as PR_SVE_GET_VL.

I think I'd drop the kernel reference here, as it feels like we're saying
"only do this if you know what you're doing" on one hand, but then "if you
don't know what you're doing, see this other documentation" on the other.
