__ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE is left untouched. :)

Afaict, your suggestion is more or less the same thing what is done
here. So I'm not sure it buys us anything apart from future
architectures not needing to set __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE3.

I expect the macro above to be only here temporarily until all arches
have caught up and we're sure that they don't require assembly stubs
(cf. [1]). A decision I'd leave to the maintainers (since even for
nios2 we were kind of on the fence what exactly the sys_clone stub was
supposed to do).

But I'm happy to take a patch from you if it's equally or more simple
than this one right here.

In any case, linux-next should be fine on all arches with this fixup
now.

[1]: Architectures such as nios2 or h8300 simply take the asm-generic
     syscall definitions and generate their syscall table from it. But
     since they don't define __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE the build would fail
     complaining about sys_clone3 missing. The reason this doesn't
     happen for legacy clone is that nios2 and h8300 provide assembly
     stubs for sys_clone but they don't for sys_clone3.
