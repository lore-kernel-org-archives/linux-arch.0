*Blink*

I failed to see that there is a refcount_inc.  Too much noise in
the header file I suppose.

But implementing refcount_inc in terms of refcount_inc_not_zero is
totally broken.  The two operations are not the same and the go to
different assumptions the code is making.

That explains why you think refcount_inc_not_zero should lie because
you are implementing refcount_inc with it.  They are semantically very
different operations.  Please separate them.
