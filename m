I was initially looking at how __read_mostly got implemented, and it
seemed like section names were done on a per-arch basis. But it
doesn't seem like that needs to be true.

Given that the other sections are in the common linux.lds.h file, it
seems unlikely to me. I'll try it in an arch-agnostic way and see what
happens. :)
