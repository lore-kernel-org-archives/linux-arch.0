(c) would break programs like GNU Emacs, which copy ru_utime and 
ru_stime members into struct timeval variables.

All in all, (b) sounds like it would be better for programs using glibc, 
as it's more compatible with what POSIX apps expect. Though I'm not sure 
what problems are meant by "possible ... incompatible definitions"; 
perhaps you could elaborate.
