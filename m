afacit the only difference between this pwritev2() and the existing
pwritev() is that pwritev2() interprets pos==-1 as "current position",
which duplicates writev()?

Unless I've missed something, there's no point in merging this
pwritev2() and it would be better to separate this syscall out into a
pwritev2() patchset which can be considered and merged separately.  For
the reasons described above.
