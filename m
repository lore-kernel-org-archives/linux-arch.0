Side note: I don't think P4 is really relevant for a performance
discussion, I was just giving it as an example where we do know actual
cycles.

I'm much more interested in modern Intel big-core CPU's, and just
wondering whether somebody could ask an architect.

Because I _suspect_ the answer from a CPU architect would be: "Christ,
the sbb/and sequence is much better because it doesn't have any extra
serialization", but maybe I'm wrong, and people feel that lfence is
particularly easy to do right without any real downside.
