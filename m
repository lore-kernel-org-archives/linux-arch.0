That doesn't really answer what I asked, though.

Do shadow stacks *require* IBT?  Or, should we concentrate on merging
shadow stacks themselves first and then do IBT at a later time, in a
different patch series?

But, yes, better patch titles would help, although I'm not sure that's
quite the format that Ingo and Thomas prefer.

Does it matter?  Does code ever get pointers to this area?  Might they
be depending on high address bits for the IBT being clear?

No.  If we have mmap() returning non-page-aligned addresses, we have
bigger problems.  Worst-case, do

	WARN_ON_ONCE(bitmap & ~PAGE_MASK);

No, I mean for code doing cet_disable_ibt() twice in a row.

No, I mean what is the in-kernel locking for the current->thread.cet
data structure?  Is there none because it's only every modified via
current->thread and it's entirely thread-local?
