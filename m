So this doesn't look interesting to me: __kernel_long_t is neither
interesting as a type anyway (it's just a way for user space to
override "long"), nor is it a namespace violation.

So honestly, user space could do whatever it wants for __kernel_long_t anyway.

The thing that I think we should try to fix is just the "val[]" thing, ie

In fact, I wouldn't even rename <posix_types.h> at all, I'd just make
sure it's namespace-clean.

I _think_ the only thing causing problems is  '__kernel_fsid_t' due to
that "val[]" thing, so just remove ity entirely, and add it to
<statfs.h> instead.

And yeah, then we'd need to maybe make sure that the (couple) of
__kernel_fsid_t users properly include that statfs.h file.

Hmm?
