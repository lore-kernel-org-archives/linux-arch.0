Since Manfred did a recent refactor of IPC RCU, and the refcount usage
is minimal, it seemed a good time to ask after these patches again.
(And send an updated one for the refactor.)

I've sent a few versions of a much faster refcount implementation
which has no measurable difference to atomic_t operations (based on
the PaX implementation). Getting more eyes on that would be nice; I'll
include you on CC when I send the next version.

Since the speed-ups will likely be arch-specific, should my proposed
CONFIG_FAST_REFCOUNT be made arch-indep when no arch-specific
implementation available (via totally unchecked atomic_t ops)? i.e.:

FAST_REFCOUNT=n: use function-based refcount_t with cmpxvhg and
full-verification
FAST_REFCOUNT=y without arch-specific implementation: use atomic_t
with no verification (i.e. no functional change from now)
FAST_REFCOUNT=y with arch-specific implementation: use atomic_t with
overflow protection

which means FAST_REFCOUNT would need to be default-on so that mm,
block, net users will remain happy.

Does that sound reasonable?
