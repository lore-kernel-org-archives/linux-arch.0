I think error code is set as ILL_ILLOPC is a good choice for normal
reserved instruction
but it seems a little bit inappropriate for nds32. For nds32 reserved
exception, It is possibly
triggered by illegal opcode, operand and immediate. Unfortunately,
do_revisn() can not
identify the actual reason now. Therefore, I chose ILLTRAP to avoid
confusing user when
the reserved exception is cauesd by wrong immediate or operand.

It is fine to commit this change along with the others.
