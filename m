OPEN_TREE_CLONE currently requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in mnt_ns->user_ns,
which requires a fork and unshare -- or at least a vfork and some other
magic -- at which point we're back to just doing a pivot_root(2) for
most operations.

I think open_tree(2) -- which I really should sit down and play around
with -- would be an interesting way of doing O_BENEATH, but I think
you'd still need to have the same race protections we have in the
current O_BENEATH proposal to handle "..".

So really you'd be using open_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE) just so that you can
use the "path.mnt" setting code, which I'm not sure is the best way of
doing it (plus the other interesting ideas which you get with the other
mount API changes).

But I am quite hopeful for what cool things we'll be able to make using
the new mount API.
