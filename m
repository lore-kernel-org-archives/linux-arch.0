True.  Looking at the prctl(2) man page it looks like other per-thread
properties are inherited across execve() in a similar way, but it's at
least worth a mention.  PR_SET_SECCOMP seems to work like this, for
example.

So, the intention is that you do a prctl(...ONEXEC) in the run up to
execve(), rather than doing it at other random times.  The primary
reason for ONEXEC is to avoid the side-effects of actually changing
the VL.


Looking at this though...
I wonder whether PR_SVE_SET_VL(... PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC) should return
the VL set for exec, rather than the current VL (which is unchanged by
definition in this case, thus uninteresting).

This would allow the ONEXEC flag to be used to probe for available VLs
without the other side-effects of changing VL, something like:

	int old = prctl(PR_SVE_GET_VL);
	int ret;

	ret = prctl(PR_SVE_SET_VL, 144 | PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC);
	if (ret == -1) {
		perror("PR_SVE_SET_VL");
		goto error;
	}

	if ((ret & PR_SVE_VL_LEN_MASK) == 144)
		have_vl_144 = true;

	if (prctl(PR_SVE_SET_VL, old | PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC) == -1) {
		perror("PR_SVE_SET_VL");
		goto error;
	}


This does _not_ do the expected thing right now, since there's no
direct way to retrieve thread.sve_vl_onexec directly from the kernel
(and it didn't really seem justified to add one).

Thoughts?
