My mail infrastructure corrupts patches not sent as attachments, sorry.

I can fix things up so that they build on Fedora 26, Debian stretch, and 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.  Would that be sufficient?

Fedora 23 is out of support and I'd prefer not invest any work into it.

Note that I find it strange to make this a precondition for even looking 
at the patch.
