I never really liked having __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE here
because it was the only one that a new architecture needed to
set: all the other __ARCH_WANT_* are for system calls that
are already superseded by newer ones, so a new architecture
would start out with an empty list.

Since __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE3 replaces
__ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE for new architectures, how about
leaving __ARCH_WANT_SYS_CLONE untouched but instead
coming up with the reverse for clone3 and mark the architectures
that specifically don't want it (if any)?
