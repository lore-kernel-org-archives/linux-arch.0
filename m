I do see the point in adding a interface like this ...

>    ssize_t readz (int fd, void *buf, size_t len, void **res)

... to help the kernel do zero-copy I/O.

I think system calls for vector I/O are *not* the right place for that
though.  Usually applications use vectored I/O because they *do* care
about the place the data is stored, because vectored I/O allows them to
avoid copying data within the application.

cheers,
