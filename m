I really think that the 32-bit interfaces are fine. So I'm literally 
suggesting a patch something like the appended.

Some notes:

 - I changed the order to "low first". Why? Because when we have it like 
   this, the 64-bit system calls now don't use the "pos_high" argument at 
   all, and it makes more sense for the native system call to simply match 
   the user-mode prototype.

   But I don't much _care_ about this particular change. I just made it 
   because it seems more logical to me, and if we're changing the order 
   anyway..

 - I checked the resulting assembly code. At least on x86-64, gcc is 
   indeed smart enough to convert the "shift by half twice" into just a 
   zero, and I get the following code:

        testq   %rcx, %rcx      # pos_l
        js      .L122   #,
        movq    %rcx, -48(%rbp) # pos_l, pos

   which is from the C source

        loff_t pos = pos_from_hilo(pos_h, pos_l);
	...
        if (pos < 0)
                return -EINVAL;

   and the 'pos_h' register isn't even touched. So this does indeed 
   improve code generation. 

 - It _used_ to generate code like

        mov     %r8d, %r8d      # pos_low, pos_low
        salq    $32, %rcx       #, tmp71
        movq    %r8, %rax       # pos_low, pos.386
        orq     %rcx, %rax      # tmp71, pos.386
        js      .L122   #,
        movq    %rax, -48(%rbp) # pos.386, pos

   which isn't _that_ horrible, but I just think the new thing is more 
   sensible. Does it really matter? Probably not. 

(In both code sequences, the actual code had other instructions 
interspersed, so the above code-sequences are just me manually picking out 
the relevant instructions. Maybe I did something wrong).

So I'm not going to commit the suggested patch, but I just personally 
think it makes more sense that way.

Note: in all cases the user code wrapper can again be the same. You can 
just do

	#define HALF_BITS (sizeof(unsigned long)*4)
	__syscall(PWRITEV, fd, iov, count, offset, (offset >> HALF_BITS) >> HALF_BITS);

or something like that (and passing in a zero for the last argument is a 
good idea, even if nobody will ever care - this will be the _least_ of our 
problems if we ever do 128-bit loff_t). So the user call wrapper isn't 
really any more complicated - the HALF_BITS thing may look more 
complicated than just doing a hard-coded '16' there twice, but if you 
understand what it's doing it's actually more logical.

I think.

Comments?
