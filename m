Good point.

Yu-cheng, can you just confirm that the bitmap can't be referenced in
ring-0, no matter what?  We should also make sure that no funny business
happens if we put an address in the bitmap that faults, or is
non-canonical.  Do we have any self-tests for that?

Let's say userspace gets a fault on this.  Do they have the
introspection capability to figure out why they faulted, say in their
signal handler?

Yeah, making userspace know how large the address space is or could be
is rather nasty, especially if we ever get any fancy CPU features that
eat up address bits (a la ARM top-byte-ignore or SPARC ADI).

> Hmm.  Can we be creative and skip populating it with zeros?  The CPU
should only ever touch a page if we miss an ENDBR on it, so, in normal
operation, we don’t need anything to be there.  We could try to prevent
anyone from *reading* it outside of ENDBR tracking if we want to avoid
people accidentally wasting lots of memory by forcing it to be fully
populated when the read it.

Won't reads on a big, contiguous private mapping get the huge zero page
anyway?

Yeah, practically, you could only make it shared if you shared the
layout of all code in the address space.  I'm sure the big database(s)
do that cross-process, but I bet nobody else does.  User ASLR
practically guarantees that nobody can do this.

That would be fun.
