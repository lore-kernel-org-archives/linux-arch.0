Yes, I did think about that too...

I just tried on the current code and it triggers easily, but that's
with that mutex patch in there. I agree it should not trigger before
that, unless something is wonky. I'll try and play around with it a bit
and see what is going on (or if I can trigger it at all with the mutex
change reverted).
