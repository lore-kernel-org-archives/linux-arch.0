  Hi folks,

Next round of the preadv & pwritev patch series, addressing review
comments:

 * Common code for the compat syscall versions is factored
   out in preparing patches.  
 * Added prototypes to syscall.h
 * Fixup some whitespace damage.

It's also the last release before I fall off the internet for the x-mas
and new-year holidays.  I'll be online again starting Jan 5th and will
deal with the remaining issues (if any) then.

cheers,
  Gerd
