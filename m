__NR_bpf was not forgotten on Alpha.  It was not wired up because
extra architecture support is needed which has not been implemented.

But maybe we should just wire it up to sys_ni_syscall in the meantime
so a syscall number is reserved for it, and user space can call it to
get -ENOSYS returned.

Cheers
