That's but an artificial limit and bound to be increased sooner rather
than later, given the trend in building ever larger machines.

If we go with the futex limit on the full tid space, we end up with 2^30
(the comment here about 29 is wrong, see FUTEX_TID_MASK).

We then still have to add a multiple of nr_cpus. Granted, that will
still be slightly short of 3^31, but not to any amount I'm really
comfortable with, we're _really_ close.

Point remains though; Changelog (and arguably the code itself) should
very much include such bits.
