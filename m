This is an overly simplified view of things.  There exist syscalls where
it's not just a matter of padding, but instead where the chosen argument
order interacts with the ABI padding requirements to produce something
which the syscall interface can't handle.  There are two solutions to
that: reorder the syscall arguments or split them up into 32-bit high/low
quantities.

I'm thinking there of the silly fadvise64_64 syscall, where ARM was forced
into having a different argument ordering from everything else through
zero discussion.

So, what would your scripts do with the fadvise64_64 syscall on an
architecture requiring natural alignment of the 64-bit args in 32-bit
regs?
