Hi all-

Since the dawn of time, a kernel stack overflow has been a real PITA
to debug, has caused nondeterministic crashes some time after the
actual overflow, and has generally been easy to exploit for root.

With this series, arches can enable HAVE_ARCH_VMAP_STACK.  Arches
that enable it (just x86 for now) get virtually mapped stacks with
guard pages.  This causes reliable faults when the stack overflows.

If the arch implements it well, we get a nice OOPS on stack overflow
(as opposed to panicing directly or otherwise exploding badly).  On
x86, the OOPS is nice, has a usable call trace, and the overflowing
task is killed cleanly.

This series (starting with this version, v4) also extensively cleans
up thread_info.  thread_info has been partially redundant with
thread_struct for a long time -- both are places for arch code to
add additional per-task variables.  thread_struct is much cleaner:
it's always in task_struct, and there's nothing particularly magical
about it.  So this series contains a bunch of cleanups on x86 to
move almost everything from thread_info to thread_struct (which,
even by itself, deletes more code than it adds) and to remove x86's
dependence on thread_info's position on the stack.  Then it opts x86
into a new config option THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK to get rid of
arch-specific thread_info entirely and simply embed a defanged
thread_info (containing only flags) and 'int cpu' into task_struct.

Once thread_info stops being magical, there's another benefit: we
can free the thread stack as soon as the task is dead (without
waiting for RCU) and then, if vmapped stacks are in use, cache the
entire stack for reuse on the same cpu.

This seems to be an overall speedup of about 0.5-1 µs per
pthread_create/join in a simple test -- a percpu cache of vmalloced
stacks appears to be a bit faster than a high-order stack
allocation, at least when the cache hits.  (I expect that workloads
with a low cache hit rate are likely to be dominated by other
effects anyway.)

This does not address interrupt stacks.

It's worth noting that s390 has an arch-specific gcc feature that
detects stack overflows by adjusting function prologues.  Arches
with features like that may wish to avoid using vmapped stacks to
minimize the performance hit.

Known issues:
 - tcp md5, virtio_net, and virtio_console will have issues.  Eric Dumazet
   has a patch for tcp md5, and Michael Tsirkin says he'll fix virtio_net
   and virtio_console.

Changes from v3:
 - Minor cleanups
 - Rebased onto Linus' tree
 - All the thread_info stuff is new

Changes from v2:
 - Delete kerne_unmap_pages_in_pgd rather than hardening it (Borislav)
 - Fix sub-page stack accounting better (Josh)

Changes from v1:
 - Fix rewind_stack_and_do_exit (Josh)
 - Fix deadlock under load
 - Clean up generic stack vmalloc code
 - Many other minor fixes
