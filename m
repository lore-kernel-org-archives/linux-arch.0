Hi Eric,

[CC linux-arch for more architecture-specific breakage]

Found it: /proc/kpageflags is always empty, as m68k doesn't set up max_pfn.

After fixing that, the test is working fine.
Funny how we managed to survive that long without setting it ;-)

Note that several other architectures also don't set max_pfn. Some may
be nommu, and are thus not affected, but others probably are:

    hexagon
    mn10300
    nios2
    score

And a few of the others (e.g. avr32, didn't check all of them) assign to a
local max_pfn variable instead of the global one, so it won't work on those
neither.

Ah, I just used "git log -p" on mlock2-tests.c, and didn't notice the commit
actually added two tests.

Thanks!
