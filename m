# git grep -n 'SYSCALL.*(nanosleep'

kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1945:SYSCALL_DEFINE2(nanosleep, struct ...
kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1965:SYSCALL_DEFINE2(nanosleep_time32, struct ...

Gives you the always correct answer including the line number.

So there is really no value in keeping those file references and have them
outdated once a function or a file moves. It's just matter of fact that
nobody ever fixes them up when a function or a file moves. Why? Because
they have no connection. The compiler does not complain and there are no
tools which could ever validate them. So removing them is the right thing
to do.
