And how would you determine the #UD is related to SGX?  Hardware doesn't
provide any indication that a #UD (or any other fault) is related to SGX
or occurred in an enclave.  The only fault that is special-cased in a
non-virtualized environment is #PF signaled by the EPCM, which gets the
PF_SGX bit set in the error code.
