I disagree, although sanity check are good too.

The very same is true of the overflow thing.

Sure..

It does not. It just got free'ed. Nothing will stop the free from
happening (or already having happened).

No, both are bugs, neither overflow not inc-from-zero _should_ happen.
The whole point is that code is buggy. If it weren't for that, we'd not
be doing this.

How is the below not useful fodder for an exploit? It might be a less
common bug, and perhaps a bit more fiddly to make work, but afaict its
still a full use-after-free and therefore useful.
