With the current implementation, I don't think you can distinguish. From
the kernel perspective, the register set is the same. What is the
use-case for this?

We could add a new regset to expose the ILP32 state (NT_ARM_..., I can't
think of a name now but probably not PER* as this implies PER_LINUX_...
which is independent from TIF_32BIT_*).

We've attempted in earlier versions to allow a mix of 32 and 64-bit
register values from ILP32 but it got pretty complicated. The entry code
would need to know which registers need zeroing of the top 32-bit and
the generic unistd.h wrapper hacks were not very nice. Some past
discussions:
