Is a race vs truncate really that time critical that you can't
wait for the thread pool to do the second read to notice it?

That is easily implementable, but I can see that for example web apps
would be happy to get as much as possible.  So if Samba can be ok
with short reads and only detecting the truncated case in the slow
path that would make life simpler.  Otherwise we might indeed need two
flags.
