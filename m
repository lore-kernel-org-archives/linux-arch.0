Hmm... why you have to decode instruction stream to find that out? Would
just depend on exception type (#GP with EPCM, #UD). Or are you saying
that kernel should need to SIGSEGV if there is in fact ENCLU so that
there is no infinite trap loop? Sorry, I'm a bit lost here that where
does this decoding requirement comes from in the first place. I
understand how it is used in Sean's proposal...

Anyway, this option can be probably discarded without further
consideration because apparently single stepping can cause #DB SS fault
if AEP handler is anything else than a single instruction.

For me it seems that by ruling out options, vDSO option is what is
left. I don't like it but at least it works...
