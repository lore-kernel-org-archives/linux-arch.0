That can be easily solved (see below).

It would make sense if this would be handled the same across architectures.

We could simply ifdef the small pkey block in mprotect.c and rely on the
pkey cond_syscalls added with e2753293ac4b. The result would actually be
the same what Mark proposed, except with less generated code.

Something like this:
