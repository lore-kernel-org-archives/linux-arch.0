(trimming Cc list, as this is getting a little off-topic most most)

Just so I understand: do you mean duplicating the .tbl file, or just
the resulting table of entry points?

In either way, how will that work with the new io_uring_setup()
system call that will have to use the compat entry point?
Are you planning to use the same syscall number as x86_64
but point it to the compat function, or do we still need a new
syscall number for x32 in the regular range?
