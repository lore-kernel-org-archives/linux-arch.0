The pointer value that is masked under speculation.

...i.e %_ASM_AX is guaranteed to be zero if userspace tries to cause
speculation with an address above the limit. The proposal is make
access_ok do that same masking so we never speculate on pointers from
userspace aimed at kernel memory.

I'd modify those as well...

So I took a closer look and the pattern is not copy_from_user it's
more like __get_user + write-to-hardware loops. If the performance is
already expected to be bad for those then perhaps an lfence each loop
iteration won't be much worse. It's still a waste because the lfence
is only needed once after the access_ok.
