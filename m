Really don't know cos i don't know the exact day when it happens. I just =
find that out on 30.8. but it could happen anytime before. Uptime on that=
 server is 27 days so maybe i can grep all syslog logs i have if it helps=
. I just need to find out the original name of that  cgroup cos i renamed=
 it to 'cannot_rm_01' so my software will ignore it.

Debug output from my own scripts which are suppose to handle this situati=
on and kill frozen processes. I already reactivated it, it is grabbing co=
ntent of 'stacks' from all processes before killing them.

From that day (30.8.)? Yes.
