Before we enshrine the overloading of EUCLEAN and EFSCORRUPTED, I
wonder if we should at least consider the option of assigning a new
error code number for EFSCORRUPTED.  The downside of doing this is
that for a while, older versions glibc won't have strerror/perror
translation for the new error code.  On the other hand, I'm not sure
it will be that much more confusing to the average user than
"Structure needs cleaning".  :-)

The upside of assigning a new error code is that in a year or two,
we'll actually have an intelligible error message showing up in log
files and in user's terminals.
