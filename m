Yeah, that's how it works.

It's not ideal.  It would be _best_ if we during mm_pkey_free(), we
ensured that no VMAs under that mm have that vma_pkey() set.  But, that
search would be potentially expensive (a walk over all VMAs), or would
force us to keep a data structure with a count of all the VMAs with a
given key.

I should probably discuss this behavior in the manpages and address it
more directly in the changelog for this patch.
