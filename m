But the keys are not shared, and they carry meaningful per thread information.

mprotect_pkey()'s effects are per MM, but the system calls related to managing the 
keys (alloc/free/get/set) are fundamentally per CPU.

Here's an example of how this could matter to applications:

 - 'writer thread' gets a RW- key into index 1 to a specific data area
 - a pool of 'reader threads' may get the same pkey index 1 R-- to read the data 
   area.

Same page tables, same index, two protections and two purposes.

With a global, per MM allocation of keys we'd have to use two indices: index 1 and 2.

Depending on how scarce the index space turns out to be making the key indices per 
thread is probably the right model.

Right now the historic pattern for signal handlers is that they safely and 
transparently stack on top of existing FPU related resources and do a save/restore 
of them. In that sense saving+clearing+restoring the pkeys state would be the 
correct approach that follows that pattern. There are two extra considerations:

- If we think of pkeys as a temporary register that can be used to access/unaccess 
  normally unaccessible memory regions then this makes sense, in fact it's more 
  secure: signal handlers cannot accidentally stomp on an encryption key or on a
  database area, unless they intentionally gain access to them.

- If we think of pkeys as permanent memory mappings that enhance existing MM
  permissions then it would be correct to let them leak into signal handler state. 
  The globl true-PROT_EXEC key would fall into this category.

So I agree, mostly: the correct approach is to save+clear+restore the first 14 
pkey indices, and to leave alone the two 'global' indices.

> 2. When thread A allocates a pkey, how does it lock down thread B?

So see above, I think the temporary key space should be per thread, so there would 
be no inter thread interactions: each thread is responsible for its own key 
management (via per thread management data in the library that implments it).
