This makes the behavior of an x86 cpu without pkeys and an arm cpu
without pkeys differ.  Is that what we want?  An application that
_wants_ to use protection keys but can't needs to handle -ENOSPC anyway.

On an architecture that will never support pkeys, it makes sense to do
-ENOSYS, but that's not the case for arm, right?
