all the above together result in bloating .text.unlikely and thus the
kernel image in general. the much bigger problem is that you introduced
a vulnerability because now refcount underflow bugs can not only trigger
a UAF but also a subsequent double-free since decrementing the saturation
value will not trigger any checks until 0 is reached a second time.

this description doesn't seem to be in sync with the code as the refcount
decrementing functions are also instrumented (and introduce the problem
mentioned above).

if you're describing differences to PaX in such detail you might as well
specify which version of PaX it is different from and credit the above idea
to me lest someone get the impression that it was yours.

while -fno-strict-overflow should save you in linux it's still not
prudent programming to rely on signed overflow, especially in security
related checks. it's just too fragile and sets a bad example...
