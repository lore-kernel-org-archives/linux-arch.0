Sure. It is in line with the MSG_DONTWAIT flag for sendmsg() which
this whole idea is based on anyways.

Okay I started rebasing the patches on-top of that. I did see that
there is a new flags field "ki_flags". I see that there's already a
IOCB_EVENTFD flag.

Did you see you Andres' question about making the flags a enum? I
usually wouldn't do that, because C++ is stronger when it comes enums,
you can't combine them then assignment them to an enum without a cast.
But in the kernel this doesn't matter.

Just got back from vacation today, I'll try to get this out before the
end of the week. I also have to make some adjustments to xfs-tests (to
push preadv2 into xfs_io).
