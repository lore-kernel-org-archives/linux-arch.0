No.

We've exposed filesystem corruption errors to userspace as errno 117
for many years now, so people are already familiar with this error
as indicating a filesystem problem.

And everyone will end up asking "WTF is this undefined error the
application just received?" until glibc, man pages and enough
occurrences of the question have been asked that the search engines
develop enough of a history record that they return useful results.
Not only won't users have a clue, but the app developers the users
first ask "what's this error mean" won't have a clue, either.

Go search for "XFS structure needs cleaning" on your preferred
search engine and will you get lots and lots of hits indicating what
you should do when you get that error. It's taken years to build up
that history such that it's extremely useful to the average user....

The downside is that it will take several years before people will
become familiar with the new error, and we'll have to deal with the
fallout repeatedly from it. Hence, IMO, there's no upside to
changing the errno of EFSCORRUPTED now that it is largely ubiquitous
in userspace.

Cheers,

Dave.
