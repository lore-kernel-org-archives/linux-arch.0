Hello.

I have some questions regarding AArch64 ILP32 implementation for which I
failed to find an answer myself:
 * How ptrace() tracer is supposed to distinguish between ILP32 and LP64
   tracees? For MIPS N32 and x32 this is possible based on syscall
   number, but for AArch64 ILP32 I do not see such a sign. There's also
   ARM_ip is employed for signalling entering/exiting, I wonder whether
   it's possible to employ it also for signalling tracee's personality.
 * What's the reasoning behind capping syscall arguments to 32 bit? x32
   and MIPS N32 do not have such a restriction (and do not need special
   wrappers for syscalls that pass 64-bit values as a result, except
   when they do,  as it is the case for preadv2 on x32); moreover, that
   would lead to insurmountable difficulties for AArch64 ILP32 tracers
   that try to trace LP64 tracees, as it would be impossible to pass
   64-bit addresses to process_vm_{read,write} or ptrace PEEK/POKE.

Thank you.
