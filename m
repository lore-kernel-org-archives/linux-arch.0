The problem is that the header was previously not used pervasively in
userspace headers.  See commit a623a7a1a5670c25a16881f5078072d272d96b71
("y2038: fix socket.h header inclusion").  Very little code needed it
before.

On the glibc side, we nowadays deal with this by splitting headers
further.  (We used to suppress definitions with macros, but that tended
to become convoluted.)  In this case, moving the definition of
__kernel_long_t to its own header, so that
include/uapi/asm-generic/socket.h can include that should fix it.

Fair enough.

Thanks,
