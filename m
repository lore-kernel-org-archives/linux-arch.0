Editing to remove use of "we" and clarify, which ends up as:

        /*
         * When switching through a kernel thread, the loop in
         * membarrier_{private,global}_expedited() may have observed that
         * kernel thread and not issued an IPI. It is therefore possible to
         * schedule between user->kernel->user threads without passing though
         * switch_mm(). Membarrier requires a barrier after storing to
         * rq->curr, before returning to userspace, so provide them here:
         *
         * - a full memory barrier for {PRIVATE,GLOBAL}_EXPEDITED, implicitly
         *   provided by mmdrop(),
         * - a sync_core for SYNC_CORE.
         */

Planning to add this:

Architectures selecting this feature need to either document that
they issue core serializing instructions when returning to user-space,
or implement their architecture-specific sync_core_before_usermode().

Thanks,
