This discussion reminds me of something I=E2=80=99m uncomfortable with in t=
he
current patches: currently, most of the O_ flags determine some
property of the returned opened file.  The new O_ flags you're adding
don't -- instead, they affect the lookup of the file.  So O_BENEATH
doesn't return a descriptor that can only be used to loop up files
beneath it -- it just controls whether open(2) succeeds or fails.  It
might be nice for the naming of the flags to reflect this.  I also
don't love that we have some magic AT_ flags that work with some
syscalls and some magic O_ flags that work with others.

In this regard, I liked the AT_ naming better.  Although I don't love
adding AT_ flags because the restrict our ability to usefully use the
high bits of the fd in the future.
