I agree with the philosophy, but I think it doesn=E2=80=99t apply in this ca=
se.  Here are the flags:

O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR: not even a proper bitmask. The kernel already ha=
s the FMODE_ bits to make this make sense. How about we make the openat2 per=
mission bits consistent with the internal representation and let the O_ perm=
ission bits remain as an awful translation.  The kernel already translates l=
ike this, and it already sucks.

O_CREAT, O_TMPFILE, O_NOCTTY, O_TRUNC: not modes on the fd at all.  These af=
fect the meaning of open().  Heck, for openat2, NOCTTY should be this defaul=
t.

O_EXCL: hopelessly overloaded.

O_APPEND, O_DIRECT, O_SYNC, O_DSYNC, O_LARGEFILE, O_NOATIME, O_PATH, O_NONBL=
OCK: genuine mode bits

O_CLOEXEC: special because it affects the fd, not the struct file.

Linus, you rejected resolveat() because you wanted a *nice* API that people w=
ould use and that might even be adopted by other OSes. Let=E2=80=99s please n=
ot make openat2() be a giant pile of crap in the name of consistency with op=
en().  open(), frankly, is horrible.
