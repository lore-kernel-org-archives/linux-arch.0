actually, i already voiced my opinion elsewhere in the constify thread on
the kernel hardening list that adding/using __read_only is somewhat premature
without also adding the compile time verification part (as part of the
constify plugin for example). right now its use on the embedded vdso image
is simple and easy to verify but once people begin to add it to variables
that the compiler knows and cares about (say, the ops structures) then
things can become fragile without compile checking. so yes, i'd also advise
to get such tooling in *before* more __read_only usage is added.
