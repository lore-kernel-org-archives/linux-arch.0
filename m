I generally like this, but, as Linus pointed out, it will be
unfortunate if application authors see this as just another
non-portable weird Linux API and don't use it.  Would it be worthwhile
to put some thought into making it an API that other OSes might be
willing to implement?  As it stands, the openat(2) flags are getting
rather crazy in this patch set.

Aleksa had a resolveat(2) proposal that really didn't seem too bad.
