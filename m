On the userspace side (elf.h) all the AT_* constants are in one file.
Why don't we just do the same here and eliminate the
arch/*/include/uapi/asm/auxvec.h files and likewise the need to
manually maintain consistency of the comments about reservations?

If there are reasons not to do that, I'm not opposed to this patch
as-is.
