Can you explain what you mean by this? Samba gets a pread
request from a client for some bytes. The client will be
confused when we send less than requested although the file
is long enough to satisfy all.

fincore would be a second syscall per pread, and it is not
atomic. I've had discussions with MIPS based vendors who
are worried about every single syscall. This is the #1
hottest code path in Samba.

If you can make sure that after an fincore the pages remain
in memory for x milliseconds the atomicity concern might go
away.
