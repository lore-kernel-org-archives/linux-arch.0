O_o how is this any less of a problem than filling a different .text
section with "lea" instructions?

This isn't an "introduced" vulnerability. With or without this patch,
an atomic_t would never stop wrapping. Without a fast refcount_t, most
of the critical parts of the kernel will not convert to refcount_t, so
they'd still be atomic_t. Regardless, you have a valid point about
this where it could be a _better_ protection, but it's not
"introducing" a vulnerability.

Hunh? Decrementing is instrumented to notice the "below 0" cases. It
gives late notification of UAF. Without instrumentation there would be
no notification at all. Neither case protects underflow, just as
you've talked about underflow not be a bug class that can be protected
against.

I am in a constant no-win situation with regard to giving credit. If I
give too much credit, it's still not specific enough, if I give too
little credit, I'm "stealing". The "v2" delta history (go see the 0/2
email) mentions where "js" came from:

v2:
...
- switch to js; pax-team

Now you're telling me your own suggestion was not prudent? What we
have now and for the foreseeable future is refcount_t being
implemented with int, and that we'll have signed overflow. If that
ever changes, refcount_t would hardly be the only thing affected.
