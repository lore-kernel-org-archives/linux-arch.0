There was some arugment that we just don't wait and don't have the
classic unix "blocking" semantics.  Maybe it's time to bite the bullet
and rename it to RWF_DONTWAIT? (I personally dont really care).

Second this probably needs to be on top of Al's for-next tree:

	https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git/log/?h=for-next

Note that this has a flags field in struct kiocb, so we could just use
that for the flags.

Otherwise this version look fine to me, let's get it merged!

Al, are yo ready to pick this up?  I'd hate to miss another merge
window.
