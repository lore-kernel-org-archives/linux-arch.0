Unfortunately, there is no generic way to detect the word size yet,
but every architecture uses its own preprocessor macro (__x86_64__,
__s390x__, __ppc64__). We also can't use CONFIG_64BIT in an user-exported
interface header file, because the use space can also be compiled for
32 bits when the kernel uses 64 bits.

__BITS_PER_LONG is actually defined in parisc now, and was the result
of the last time we had this discussion. I'm still thinking about
making a separate <asm/bitsperlong.h> header, or a <asm/bits.h> that
also contains the respective __BIG_ENDIAN/__LITTLE_ENDIAN macros
which have the same problem. The advantage would be that other header
files (e.g. unistd.h) can known the word size without getting the
whole types.h name space.
