Thanks for cleaning this up.

It looks like us (powerpc) / me is the main offender here.

My excuse is it was glibc folk who asked us to add all those new AT_
entries in the first place. </buckpassing>

Yeah I agree with Rich that having a global list would be best. That is
the most reliable to make people think twice about adding new entries.

I don't know why we added the new entries starting at 40, maybe Ben
remembers. Quite likely it was just an accident.

I don't see any sign of 38 or 39 in glibc history.

cheers
