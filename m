Taking a step back, I think it would be fantastic if we could find a
way to make this work without any inheritable settings at all.
Perhaps we could have a per-mm value that is initialized to 2^47-1 on
execve() and can be raised by ELF note or by prctl()?  Getting it
right for 32-bit would require a bit of thought.  The ELF note would
make a high stack possible and, without the ELF note, we'd get a low
stack but high mmap().  Then the messy bits can be glibc's problem and
a toolchain problem as it should be, given that the only reason we
need a limit at all is because of messy userspace code.

Sure, the low stack prevents the *whole* address space from being used
in one big block for databases, but 2^57 - 2^47 ought to be good
enough.

I'm not 100% sure this is workable but, if it is, it makes everyone's
life easier.  There's no need to muck around with setarch(1) or
similar hacks.
