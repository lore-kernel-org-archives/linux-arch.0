By the time we get to de-reference uptr we know it is not pointing at
kernel memory, because access_ok would have failed and the cpu would
have waited for that failure result before doing anything else.

Now the vulnerability that still exists after this fence is if we do
something with the value returned from de-referencing that pointer.
I.e. if we do:

get_user(val, uptr);
if (val < array_max)
    array[val];

...then we're back to having a user controlled pointer in the kernel.
This is the point where we need array_ptr() to sanitize things.
