As large as this patch set is, I'd really prefer to see you get shadow
stacks merged and then move on to IBT.  I say separate them.

I'm concerned with two things:
1. the virtual address space consumption, especially the *default* case
   which will be apps using 4-level address space amounts, but having
   5-level-sized tables.
2. the driving a truck-sized hole in the address space limits

You can force legacy libs to low addresses, but you can't stop anyone
from putting code into a high address *later*, at least with the code we
have today.
