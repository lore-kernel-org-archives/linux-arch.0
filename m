I don't think it can entirely be a kernel command line option.  On ARM,
enabling DEBUG_RODATA has a substantial effect on the size of the kernel
image - we have to pad various sections to 1MB boundaries so we can
set the appropriate permissions.

Forcing this layout on everyone won't work.

What we can do is the half-way house: we can have the kernel command
line option which enables and disables the protections, but the layout
of the kernel image would still need to be controlled by DEBUG_RODATA.
I'm left wondering what the advantage of that would be: it'd end up
offering a suboptimal layout, additional memory usage but without the
benefits of memory protections.

The alternative is keeping the kernel in unlinked object form, and
laying out and linking the kernel at boot time, probably in PIC
assembly code.  That's possible but I think is undesirable.

So all in all, I'm in favour of keeping things as they are on ARM.
