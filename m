Define "VSYSCALL kernels."  On any remotely recent kernel (*all* new
kernels and all kernels for the last several years that haven't
specifically requested vsyscall=native), using vsyscalls is much, much
slower than just doing syscalls.  I know a way you can tell whether
vsyscalls are fast, but it's unreliable, and I'm disinclined to
suggest it.  There are also at least two pending patch series that
will interfere.

Is anything preventing you from adding a vDSO parser?  I wrote one
just for this type of use:

$ wc -l tools/testing/selftests/vDSO/parse_vdso.c
269 tools/testing/selftests/vDSO/parse_vdso.c

(289 lines includes quite a bit of comment.)


$ head -n8 tools/testing/selftests/vDSO/parse_vdso.c

If this license is too restrictive for you, I could probably be
convinced to relicense it, I'd be surprised :)  In hindsight, I kind
of wish I'd used MIT instead, since the Go runtime took advantage of
the CC0 license to import it without attribution *and* break it quite
badly in the process.

IMO the correct solution is to parse the vDSO and, if that fails, to
use plain syscalls as a fallback.  You should not ship anything that
uses a vsyscall under any circumstances, unless you need the last
ounce of performance on that one ancient version of OpenSuSE that
crashes if the vDSO is enabled.
