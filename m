Hmm, none of those are described in the man page. I am usually very
careful to not add new and potentially unexpected error codes but it is
true that a new flag should warrant a new error code. I am not sure
which one is more appropriate though. EBUSY suggests that retrying might
help which is true only if some other party unmaps the range. So EEXIST
would sound more natural.

I see. Could you be more specific about the usecase you have in mind? I
would incorporate it into the patch description.
