Yes please -- Andy, Eric, Al?

Thanks (for some reason I though cc'ing linux-api took care of Michael
seeing it).

Looks like the robots have also found a few things that need fixing:
 1) Sparse warning on "close_on_exec(fd, current->files->fdt)": I guess
    that needs a rcu_dereference_raw() or some such around arg2.
 2) Syscall not implemented warning on sparc build: I could attempt to wire
    up the sparc syscall (although I can only cross-compile it, not run it),
    or is it best to leave it and ask sparclinux / David Miller nicely to take
    care of it?  Or have I just missed some bit of syscall machinery?
 3) Non-canonical comment format just before the close_on_exec() call.
(Well, that last wasn't found by a robot -- thanks Andrew!)

When I generate a new version, would it be easier for you if I also merged up
against v3.18-rc4?  That would at least take care of the syscall renumbering.
