I think many of the issues are specific to Linux (and Linux containers
especially), so I'm not sure this should get blocked because we want
something more portable.

This series provides solutions to so many different race and confusion
issues, I'd really like to see it land. What's the next step here? Is
this planned to go directly to Linus for v5.2, or is it going to live
in -mm for a while? I'd really like to see this moving forward.

Thanks for continuing to work on it!
