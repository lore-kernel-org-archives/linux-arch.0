Agreed. We should be absolutely clear about when this thing works and when
it doesn't.

I'd rather avoid imposing that limitation and instead just treat uaccess
specially. It looks like we can satisfy the current definition of
array_ptr_mask with three instructions, but I'm not sure how we could get it
working on arm64 if we needed to deal with arbitrary sizes (particularly as
we're trying to avoid conditional instructions).
