Agreed.  To my knowledge no one has figured out how to make that work
yet.  For the most part it has been unnecessary.

Frankly.  Given that there are some very good solutions in other
operating systems, I think the misdesign is in unix/linux not providing
a good answer to what to do when you need more than 6 arguments to a
system call.

I certainly agree that seccomp should not be the sole reason for not
doing something.  However there are lots of reasons to avoid
extensibility in general.

Excess extensibility has been the cause of more than one security issue.

Lots of flexibility comes at the price of lots of conditional execution
which tends to explode the test matrix of possibilities to test, with
the result that some combinations are never thought about or tested
because they don't make sense to combine.  Then someone with
mischievious intent see that combination and thinks what happens when I
do this.

Further that conditional execution can frequently be the cause of slow
code as well.

So while there are many nice features of tagged values.  I don't think
they are a general solution.  The lack of seccomp support (today) is
just one downside among many.


I do think it would be nice to have a general pattern for those
system calls that require extensibility.  My gut feel says something
like the L4 pseudo registers (to give a maxium request size)
combined with something like netlink encoding would make a very
nice template for making fast and flexible system calls.
