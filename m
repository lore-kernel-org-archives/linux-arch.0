The ABI was supposed to be finalized and everyone involved thought it
had been reviewed by the GNU gABI community and other interested
parties.  It had been included in binutils for several releases.

From my point of view, the kernel is just a consumer of the ABI.  The
kernel would not change an instruction encoding if it doesn't like it
for some reason, either.

They were developed against the ABI specification.

I do not have a strong opinion what the kernel should do going forward.
I just want to make clear what happened.

Thanks,
