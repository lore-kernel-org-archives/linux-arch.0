The problem is that many applications (including samba!) want
all-or-nothing behaviour, and preadv2() cannot provide it.  By the time
preadv2() discovers a not-present page, it has already copied bulk data
out to userspace.

To fix this, preadv2() would need to take two passes across the pages,
pinning them in between and somehow blocking out truncate.  That's a
big change.

With the current preadv2(), applications would have to do

	nr_read = preadv2(..., offset, len, ...);
	if (nr_read == len)
		process data;
	else
		punt(offset + nr_read, len - nr_read);

and the worker thread will later have to splice together the initial
data and the later-arriving data, probably on another CPU, probably
after the initial data has gone cache-cold.

A cleaner solution is

	if (fincore(fd, NULL, offset, len) == len) {
		preadv(..., offset, len);
		process data;
	} else {
		punt(offset, len);
	}

This way all the data gets copied in a single hit and is cache-hot when
userspace processes it.

Comparing fincore()+pread() to preadv2():

pros:

a) fincore() may be used to provide both all-or-nothing and
   part-read-ok behaviour cleanly and with optimum cache behaviour.

b) fincore() doesn't add overhead, complexity and stack depth to
   core pagecache read() code.  Nor does it expand VFS data structures.

c) with a non-NULL second argument, fincore provides the
   mincore()-style page map.

cons:

d) fincore() is more expensive

e) fincore() will very occasionally block


Tradeoffs are involved.  To decide on the best path we should examine
d).  I expect that the overhead will be significant for small reads but
not significant for medium and large reads.  Needs quantifying.

And I don't believe that e) will be a problem in the real world.  It's
a significant increase in worst-case latency and a negligible increase
in average latency.  I've asked at least three times for someone to
explain why this is unacceptable and no explanation has been provided.
