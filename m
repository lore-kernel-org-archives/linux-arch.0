Fair point! Hence the "RFC". ;)

So I understand better your intent to use the pt_regs to figure out whether=
 it
is compat or not. My is_compat_frame()+in_compat_syscall() approach does no=
t
handle this correctly.

I'm OK with turning the rseq_cs start_ip, post_commit_offset, and abort_ip
fields into normal u64.

The LINUX_FIELD_ macros are still needed to ensure single-copy updates of
the (struct rseq *__tls_abi)->rseq_cs pointer by 32-bit user-space.

I like the approach of dealing with the rseq_cs fields as u64 even on 32-bi=
t
architectures. As a downside, it will require 32-bit architectures to do
arithmetic on 64-bit values, but it's not a fast-path. As you point out, th=
e
tricky bit is to decide what happens when architecture code returns to
userspace with regs->ip containing garbage in the high bits.

An alternative approach is to ensure the high bits are cleared when returni=
ng
to an IP with garbage in the high bits.

Dealing with u64 for start_ip, post_commit_offset, and abort_ip at the kern=
el
level would indeed provide this characteristic. However, I'm uneasy adding
64-bit arithmetic on operations really caring about 32 bits on 32-bit archs=
,
even though those are not fast paths.

Thanks,

Mathieu
