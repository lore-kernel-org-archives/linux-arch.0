I couldn't figure out which kernel object this maps to.  There's no
device, no driver.  This isn't even per-cpu.

sysctl is already used for similar knobs to this one, so I followed that
precedent -- though if someone argues strongly enough it could be
changed.

Are there already examples of arch controls like this in sysfs?  I
wasn't aware of any, but I didn't look all that hard...
