Part of the problem is that there are different sub-classes of Spectre
variant1 vulnerabilities. For example, speculating on the value of a
user pointer returned from get_user() is mitigated by these kernel
changes. However, cleaning up occasions where the CPU might speculate
on the validity of a user-controlled pointer offset, or
user-controlled array index is only covered by manual inspection of
some noisy / incomplete tooling results. I.e. the handful of
array_index_nospec() usages in this series is likely incomplete.

The usage of barrier_nospec() in __get_user() and open coded
array_index_nospec() in get_user() does raise the bar and mitigates an
entire class of problems. Perhaps it would be reasonable to have
cpu_show_spectre_v1() emit:

    "Mitigation: __user pointer sanitization"

...with the expectation that the kernel community intends to use new
and better tooling to find more places to use array_index_nospec().
Once there is wider confidence in that tooling, or a compiler that
does it automatically, the kernel can emit:

    "Mitigation: automated user input sanitization"

...or something like that.
