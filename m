The tricky corner case are 32bit compat syscalls on 64bit kernel, where
a noticable number of archs (IIRC at least ppc, mips and s390) can't
pass unaligned 64bit values through the syscall abi.  The 32/32 split
was done because of that.

I think using two unsigned longs instead of two u32 should work.  And
allows us to handle 128bit file offsets on 64bit.  That I'll call
future-proof interface!  Nevertheless I'd like to have comments from the
arch maintainers on the idea.

cheers,
