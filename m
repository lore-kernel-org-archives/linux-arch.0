Joahnnes,

looks like the problem is completely resolved :) Thank you, Michal Hocko =
and everyone involved for help and time.

One more thing:
I see that your patches are going into 3.12. Is there a chance to get the=
m also into 3.2? Is Ben Hutchings (current maintainer of 3.2 branch) comp=
etent to decide this? Should i contact him directly? I can't upgrade to 3=
.12 because stable grsecurity is for 3.2 and i don't think this will chan=
ge in near future.
