Yes, I am not concerned about page faults or the kernel not being able
to handle ENOMEM. I was more worried about somebody relying on kmalloc
allocation trigger OOM (e.g. fork bomb hitting kmem limit). This
wouldn't be a good idea in the first place but I wanted to hear back
from those who use kmem accounting for something real.

I would rather see no-oom from kmalloc until oom is kmem aware.

It seems that your previous patch got merged already (3812c8c8). Could
you post your new version on top of the merged one, please? I am getting
lost in the current patch flow.

I will try to review it before I leave (on Friday).

Thanks!
