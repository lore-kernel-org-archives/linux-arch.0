I've tried non-leaf and it works too. I'd be fine with switching to it,
I'm not sure which would be better for the kernel.

What kind of experiments did you have in mind? If I understand
correctly, then compared to non-leaf, "all" additionally protects leaf
functions that write to the stack. I don't know how many of those there
are in the kernel (or will be in the future). I also don't know the
additional performance impact of "all", as I don't think we have any
v8.3 hardware to test on yet. There is a minor code size impact (0.36%
on the current kernel), but I'm not sure how much that matters.

Thanks. I expect it will be a separate Kconfig option to build the
kernel with BTI and pointer auth, yes.
