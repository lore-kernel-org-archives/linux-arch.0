It seems to add about 1.5=C2=B5s to pthread_create+join on my laptop.  (On
an unmodified, stripped-down kernel, it took about 7=C2=B5s before.  On a
Fedora system, the baseline is much worse.)  I think that most of the
overhead is because vmalloc allocates one page at a time, which means
that it won't use a higher order page even if one is sitting on a
freelist.

I can imagine better integration with the page allocator in which
higher order pages are used if readily available.  Similarly, vfree
could free pages that happen to be aligned and consecutive as a unit
to avoid the overhead of merging them back together one at a time.

But I'm not planning on doing any of this myself any time soon.  I
just want to get the code working and merged.
