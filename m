I added the following text to pkey_alloc.2.  I somehow neglected to send
it out in the v3 update of the manpages RFC:

An application should not call
.BR pkey_free ()
on any protection key which has been assigned to an address
range by
.BR pkey_mprotect ()
and which is still in use.  The behavior in this case is
undefined and may result in an error.

I'll add that in the version (v4) I send out shortly.

Protection keys has the potential to add a layer of security and
reliability to applications.  But, it has not been primarily designed as
a security feature.  For instance, WRPKRU is a completely unprivileged
instruction, so pkeys are useless in any case that an attacker controls
the PKRU register or can execute arbitrary instructions.

That said, this mechanism does, indeed, allow a user to shoot themselves
in the foot and in a way that could have security implications.

For instance, say the following happened:
1. A sensitive bit of data in memory was marked with a pkey
2. That pkey was set as PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
3. The application called pkey_free() on the pkey, without freeing
   the sensitive data
4. Application calls pkey_alloc() and then clears PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
5. Applocation can now read the sensitive data

The application has to have basically "leaked" a reference to the pkey.
 It forgot that it had sensitive data marked with that key.

The kernel _could_ enforce that no in-use pkey may have pkey_free()
called on it.  But, doing that has tradeoffs which could make
pkey_free() extremely slow:

In addition, that checking _could_ be implemented in an application by
inspecting /proc/$pid/smaps for "ProtectionKey: $foo" before calling
pkey_free($foo).
