I'm an outside reviewer, not subscribed to the list, so forgive me if I 
do something not according to protocol. I have the following comments on 
this change:

After discarding the speculation barrier variant, is array_ptr() needed 
at all? You could have a simpler sanitizing macro, say

#define array_sanitize_idx(idx, sz) ((idx) & array_ptr_mask((idx), (sz)))

(adjusted to not evaluate idx twice). And use it as follows:

if (idx < array_size) {
     idx = array_sanitize_idx(idx, array_size);
     do_something(array[idx]);
}

If I understand the speculation stuff correctly, unlike array_ptr(), 
this "leaks" array[0] rather than nothing (*NULL) when executed 
speculatively. However, it's still much better than leaking an arbitrary 
location in memory. The attacker can likely get array[0] "leaked" by 
passing 0 as idx anyway.

Why does this have to resort to the undefined behavior of shifting a 
negative number to the right? You can do without it:

return ((idx | (sz - 1 - idx)) >> (BITS_PER_LONG - 1)) - 1;

Of course, you could argue that subtracting 1 from 0 to get all ones is 
also an undefined behavior, but it's still much better than the shift, 
isn't it?

Call me paranoid, but I think this may actually create an exploitable 
bug on 32-bit systems due to casting the index to an unsigned long, if 
the index as it comes from userland is a 64-bit value. You have 
*replaced* the "if (idx < array_size)" check with checking if 
array_ptr() returns NULL. Well, it doesn't return NULL if the low 32 
bits of the index are in-bounds, but the high 32 bits are not zero. 
Apart from the return value pointing to the wrong place, the subsequent 
code may then assume that the 64-bit idx is actually valid and trip on 
it badly.
