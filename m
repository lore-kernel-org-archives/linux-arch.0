"after"? Don't you mean "before"? Otherwise I don't understand what
you're saying here.

Note that a fixed-size path buffer means that if the path is very
long, e.g. because you followed long symlinks on the way down, this
can cause lookup failures.

I find the semantics of this check odd - especially in the
LOOKUP_BENEATH case, but also in the LOOKUP_CHROOT case. Wouldn't it
make more sense to just throw an error here? Making /.. go back to the
root is one thing, but making ".." from anything that has escaped from
the root go back to the root seems less logical to me.

Imagine, for example:

Thread A (a webserver or whatever) looks up
"example.org/images/foo/../bar.png" under "/var/www" with
LOOKUP_BENEATH.
Thread B concurrently moves "/var/www/example.org/images" to
"/var/backup/example.org/images".
Now thread A can accidentally resolve its path to "/var/www/bar.png"
if the race happens the wrong way?
