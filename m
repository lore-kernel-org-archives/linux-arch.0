We're getting data from a network filesystem Ceph in our case, but it
could be pNFS. In many cases those filesystems have some kind
hierarchy and it's not uncommon for us to se requests that take 20 to
25 milliseconds to complete. In this case the miss becomes very
expensive. And it's not just that one requests experiences the slow
down all the request being serviced by that (single) epoll thread
experience head-of-line blocking because of one stalled request.

10K request a second is a common load for many web services / video
servers servings chunks of data. If we experience one miss a second,
that 25 million stall will impact 250 other requests (all of them will
have a 25ms latency tacked on).
