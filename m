I have two issues with this approach:

1. The kernel needs some way to know *when* to apply this fixup.
Decoding the instruction stream and doing it to all exceptions that
hit an ENCLU instruction seems like a poor design.

2. It starts exposing what looks like a more generic exception
handling mechanism to userspace, except that it's nonsensical for
anything other than ENCLU.
