I haven't thought about this much in a year or so, but I think this is
doable.

One bit of advice: please look at features when they go in to the
kernel.  Your feedback has been valuable, but not very timely.  I
promise you'll get better results if you give feedback when patches are
being posted rather than when they've been in the kernel for a year.

I'll also note that TLB flushes are transparent to software.  What you
are suggesting is not.  That makes it a *LOT* more difficult to implement.

If you have an idea how to do this, I'll happily review patches!

BTW, I never call this feature MPK because it looks too much like MPX
and they have nothing to do with each other.  I'd recommend the same to
you.  It keeps your audience less confused.

I understand there is some distaste for where the implementation
settled.  I don't, either, in a lot of ways.  If I were to re-architect
it in the CPU, I certainly wouldn't have a user-visible PKRU and and
found a way to avoid the signal PKRU issues.  But, that ship has sailed.

I don't see a way to do a broadcast PKRU update.  But, I'd love to be
proven wrong, with code.
