I think that one way to solve this problem might be to have more strict
checks on nd->root in follow_dotdot(). The problem here (as far as I can
tell) is that ".." could end up skipping past the root because of a
rename, however walking *down* into a path shouldn't be a problem (even
absolute symlinks shouldn't be a problem because they will nd_jump_root
and will land back in the root).

However, I'm not entirely sure what happens to nd->root if it gets
renamed -- can you still safely do checks against it (we'd need to do
some sort of is_descendant() check on the current path before we handle
".." in follow_dotdot).

That way, we wouldn't shouldn't have the spectre-like attack problem
(since the attack would be halted at the ".." stage -- before the path
walk can proceed into host paths). Would this be sufficient or is there
a more serious issue I'm missing?

I went into this in my response to Jann.
