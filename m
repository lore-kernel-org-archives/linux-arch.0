What I meant was writing to the page through the linear mapping
rather than the virtual mapping at 0xffff0000 so we can leave that
one read-only (I did not consider whether that might cause cache
aliasing problems when reading from the other address).

Your other point is more important though: if one really cares
about optimizing security here, they probably should disable
kuser helpers completely anyway.

Kees, is that something you have on your radar already?
