Isn't it just scripts that get confused here (as normal executables don't
get to see brpm->filename)?

Given that we don't know which we have at this point, I'd suggest
carrying on regardless.  Or we could fall back to use the previous
best-effort d_path() code for O_CLOEXEC fds.  Thoughts?

I guess we could kmalloc(strlen(filename->name) + 19) to avoid the
possibility of failure, but that just defers the inevitable -- the interpreter
won't be able to open the script file anyway.  But it would at least then
generate the appropriate error (ENAMETOOLONG rather than ENOENT).
