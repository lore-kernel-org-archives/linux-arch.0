There will always be holes.  For example find_get_page() could block on
lock_page() while some other process is doing IO. 
page_cache_async_readahead() does lots of memory allocation which can
get blocked for long periods in the page allocator. 
page_cache_async_readahead() can block on synchronous metadata reads,
etc.

The question is whether a simpler approach such as fincore() will be
sufficient.

Details?

Do we actually need pwritev2()?  What's the justification for that?


Please let's examine the alternative(s) seriously.  It would be mistake
to add preadv2/pwritev2 if fincore+pread would have sufficed.
