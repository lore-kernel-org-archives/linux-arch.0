As usual, each patch needs a changelog text. I would prefer having a single
patch here that changes /all/ system call tables at once, rather than doing one
at a time like we used to.

In linux-next, we are at number 434 now, and there are a couple of other
new system calls being proposed right now (more than usual), so you may
have to change the number a few times.

Note: most architectures use .tbl files now, the exceptions are
include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h and arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h,
and the latter also requires changing __NR_compat_syscalls in asm/unistd.h.

Numbers should now be the same across architectures, except for alpha,
which has a +110 offset. We have discussed ways to have a single
file to modify for a new call on all architectures, but no patches yet.
