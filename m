Let's check with the other implementation...

Ram, this is a question about the signal handler behavior on POWER.  I
thought you ended up having different behavior in signal handlers than x86.

In any case, I think the question still stands: Do we want this to be
pkeys-only, or build it so that it can be used for MPX and any future
XSAVE features that need non-init values when entering a signal handler.
