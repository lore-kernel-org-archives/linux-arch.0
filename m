Right, the comment is stale.

dma_addr_t is a big mess that was traditionally defined per
architecture, in lots of wrong ways, including the misconception
of dma64_addr_t. Sparc64 still uses a 32 bit dma_addr_t, possibly
because it always uses an IOMMU (?). It can save some space in
scatterlists, but might come back to bite us if someone tries
to build a sparc64 system with actual 64-bit DMA.

phys_addr_t is a new definition that was added last August (after
I did my patch) by Jeremy Fitzhardinge and is for DMA purposes.

Yes, they could be consolidated now, which would make the default
dma_addr_t the same as phys_addr_t, with the possible exception of
sparc64.
