I just found myself wanting this syscall for another reason: injecting
programs into sandboxes or otherwise heavily locked-down namespaces.

For example, I want to be able to reliably do something like nsenter
--namespace-flags-here toybox sh.  Toybox's shell is unusual in that
it is more or less fully functional, so this should Just Work (tm),
except that the toybox binary might not exist in the namespace being
entered.  If execveat were available, I could rig nsenter or a similar
tool to open it with O_CLOEXEC, enter the namespace, and then call
execveat.

Is there any reason that these patches can't be merged more or less as
is for 3.19?
