Well, or, it's good: that's the point of it. Either from the
perspective of robustness or from that of security.

As PaX Team mentions, it should be easy to catch these traps and
report them. That could certainly be a nice addition.

There are many more pieces to add to the annotation use, but I don't
want to risk getting us into a Catch-22. Emese's work on the plugin
side will see this usage and utility grow, and I think getting these
basic building blocks in place is the right place to start.
