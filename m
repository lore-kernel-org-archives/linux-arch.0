For worst case analysis we have to assume it does, unless we can proof
it doesn't. And that proof is very very hard, and would need to be
redone every time the kernel changes.

What 0 count check are you talking about, the one that triggers when we
want to increment 0 ?

I think I've explained that before; per reference count rules 0 means
freed (or about to be freed when we talk RCU).

The whole pattern:

	if (dec_and_test(&obj->ref))
		kfree(obj);

expresses this etc.. Other reference counts also do this. No references
means its getting freed.

Can you agree with this?


If so; any attempt to increase the reference count while its (being)
freed() is a use-after-free.

Therefore we disallow 0 increment.


Yes, this is an annoyance when you consider usage-counts, where 0 means
something else. But then, we were talking about reference counts, not
something else.
