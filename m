Not sure about your dog but mine says that a flag which fixes an
_unsafe_ aspects of MAP_FIXED can be called MAP_FIXED_SAFE just fine.

Anyway, I am not going to argue about this further. I've implemented the
code, gathered uscases and fortified an in-kernel user which already led
to a security issue in the past. I consider my part done here. I do not
agree that MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE would be so much better to respin and
then deal with what about this MAP_$FOO. If there are really stong
feelings about this then feel free to take these patches, do
s@MAP_FIXED_SAFE@MAP_$FOO@ and try to upstream them yourself.
