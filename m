Yes, there is new DWARF frame information for pointer authentication to des=
cribe
the signing status at instruction level.  There is no ELF annotation on an =
image.

As the use cases of pointer authentication extension in GCC are about retur=
n
address signing.  The DWARF extension is mostly around describing signed LR=
 so
the unwinder could have a way to figure out the original value of it to con=
tinue
unwinding.

In general, whenever return address, i.e. LR register, is mangled or restor=
ed by
hardware instruction, compiler (or assembly writer) is expected to generate=
 a
DW_CFA_AARCH64_negate_ra_state CFA instruction.

For DWARF unwinder, during unwinding, whenever a DW_CFA_AARCH64_negate_ra_s=
tate
is hit, the unwinder toggle the LR signing status and kept it in bit zero (=
lsb)
of a new DWARF register AARCH64_DWARF_PAUTH_RA_STATE whose value must be ho=
nored
later when unwinding the value of LR. If the lsb of AARCH64_DWARF_PAUTH_RA_=
STATE
is set, it means the return address is mangled, then the unwinder needs to
restore LR by either masking off the signature (userspace unwinders need pt=
race
interface to get this) or executing signature strip instruction (can only b=
e
done by native unwinder) or executing authentication instruction (can only =
be
done by native unwinder).
