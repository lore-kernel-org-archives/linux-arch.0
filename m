I don't see a good reason to reserve the syscall slot if seccomp
filter is not already implemented. I've CCed linux-api in case there
is something I'm not considering, though.

FWIW, if someone wants to add it for m68k, the steps to support
seccomp are listed in the arch/Kconfig for HAVE_ARCH_SECCOMP_FILTER.
