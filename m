I must admit that I=E2=80=99m not very sympathetic to the argument that =E2=80=
=9CGo=E2=80=99s runtime model is incompatible with the simpler solution.=E2=80=
=9D

Anyway, it occurs to me that the real problem is that setns() and chroot() a=
re both overkill for this use case. What=E2=80=99s needed is to start your w=
alk from /proc/pid-in-container/root, with two twists:

1. Do the walk as though rooted at a directory. This is basically just your A=
T_THIS_ROOT, but the footgun is avoided because the dirfd you use is from a f=
oreign namespace, and, except for symlinks to absolute paths, no amount of .=
. racing is going to escape the *namespace*.

2. Avoid /proc. It=E2=80=99s not just the *links* =E2=80=94 you really don=E2=
=80=99t want to walk into /proc/self. *Maybe* procfs is already careful enou=
gh when mounted in a namespace?
