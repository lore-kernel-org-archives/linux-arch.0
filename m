no, that'd be undefined behaviour and in practice gcc would take advantage
of it and produce unintended (and quite broken) code. if the constified object
is modified from a different translation unit then the compiler is free
to assume that it can constant propagate its initialization value into uses,
completely breaking the code that (forcibly) writes to it.

however as a poor man's detector for such __read_only violations it's
possible to just make the object const temporarily (without casting away
the write attempts!), recompile the tree and see if any writes outside
__init functions pop up.
