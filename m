So I tried to limit the list of features to those that represent the 
overall progress of the generic kernel and are recommended on all 
architectures that are able to support it.

There are certainly features that are opt-in. We could still list them 
here as well, because this is a convenient central index, but would 
mark them not with 'TODO' but with a low-key '..' marking?

On the other end of the spectrum we could also define 'must have' 
features for new architectures. For example modern-timekeeping and 
clockevents.

The patch that adds a new architecture to all these files would give 
us a good overview about how complete an initial port is.

It's a starting point and nicely extensible. I was thinking about one 
more intermediate level:

   Documentation/features/locking/lockdep/
   Documentation/features/locking/rwsem-optimized/
   Documentation/features/locking/queued-rwlocks/
   Documentation/features/locking/queued-spinlocks/
   ...

   Documentation/features/vm/PG_uncached/
   Documentation/features/vm/pmdp_splitting_flush/
   Documentation/features/vm/pte_special/
   ...

The advantage of this, beyond more structure, would be that I'd 
probably move most of the Documentation/locking/*.txt files into 
Documentation/features/locking/, for example lockdep-design.txt would 
go into Documentation/features/locking/lockdep/.

I'd keep the hierarchy at a predictable depth though, i.e.:

   Documentation/features/<subsystem>/<feature_name>/

Ok.

Yeah.

I think we god some feedback from the PowerPC side, but yeah, would be 
nice to get more reactions.

Thanks,
