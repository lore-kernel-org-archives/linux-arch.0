Thanks for confirming.

So how can we move this forward?  Should I submit a single new patch 
with the new flag with a more appropriate name (PKEY_ALLOC_SIGNALINHERIT 
comes to my mind) and the signal inheritance change?

Dave, do you still want to wait for feedback from the x86 maintainer 
regarding a general interface?  Is this really feasible without detailed 
knowledge of the XSAVE output structure?  Otherwise, there probably 
isn't a way around code which explicitly copies the bits we want to 
preserve from the interrupted CPU context to the signal handler context.

Thanks,
Florian
