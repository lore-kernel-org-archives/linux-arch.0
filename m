In general, getting no feedback does not mean something's ready ;-)

Your patches look pretty polished though, and IIRC the only
real objection was to whether or not the syscalls should be
there in the first place. Did you get any feedback from Ulrich
Drepper as to whether he plans to add support to glibc?

I'd say get it into linux-next as a git tree, then let the arch maintai=
ners
send you the missing patches to hook up the syscalls so that it can go
in as one chunk.

Have you done the glibc patch already? You probably also need to provid=
e
an alternative user space implementation based on a pread/pwrite loop f=
or
older kernels.
