You're right that (looking at this again) this chunk doesn't make too
much sense -- though I still think it wouldn't be a bad idea to include
it without the WARN_ON.

The reason I added it was as an attempt to have a last-chance check to
make sure we don't hand out a file descriptor to userspace that is
outside nd->root as a result of some yet-unknown namei bug (hence the
WARN_ON). But you're quite right that I overlooked that user-space could
trigger this maliciously.

Regarding the warranties LOOKUP_IS_SCOPED is supposed to provide --
arguably the guarantee is meant to be "you never step outside the root
during lookup" but that should already be implemented with the
handle_dots() checks -- and it's not something you could easily check at
the end of a lookup anyway. The idea was that (if for some reason those
checks were bypassed), at the very least you wouldn't silently get a
file descriptor which is completely outside the root.

Looking at this again, I can see the argument that check this shouldn't
be done at all -- but I will admit that I feel more comfortable with the
guarantees of LOOKUP_IS_SCOPED if we had some kind of last-chance check
to avoid a privileged process opening /etc/shadow on the host. Then
again, libpathrs (which I assume will be the primary consumer of
LOOKUP_IN_ROOT) already does a double-check in userspace after getting
the file descriptor from openat2().

All of that being said, I'd be happy to drop it entirely if you feel
it's unnecessary.
