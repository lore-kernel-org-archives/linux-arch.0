Agreed -- I think this can just be unsigned int here, which is the type
I use everywhere except when encoding the vector length in the signal
frame and ptrace data.

During development, there was an additional flags field here (now
merged into the thread_info flags).  u16 was big enough for the largest
architectural vector length, so it seemed "tidy" to make both u16s.
Elsewhere, this created a risk of overflow if you try to compute say
the size of the whole register file from a u16, so I generally used
unsigned int for local variables in functions that handle the vl.

Agreed, I need to look more closely at exactly how to justify the
soundness of this in order to thin out BUG_ONs.

If you need any pointers, please ping me.  In the meantime, I would
rather not colour your judgement by infecting you with my assumptions ;)

Yup, I've already picked those up.

I'll be posting a v2 with feedback applied once I've reviewed the
existing BUG_ON()s -- should happen sometime this week.

Cheers
