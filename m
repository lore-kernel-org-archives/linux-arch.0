Like mentioned elsewhere; if you do write_enable() + write_disable()
thingies, it all becomes:

	write_enable();
	atomic_foo(&bar);
	write_disable();

No magic gunk infested duplication at all. Of course, ideally you'd then
teach objtool about this (or a GCC plugin I suppose) to ensure any
enable reached a disable.

The alternative is something like:

#define ALLOW_WRITE(stmt) do { write_enable(); do { stmt; } while (0); write_disable(); } while (0)

which then allows you to write:

	ALLOW_WRITE(atomic_foo(&bar));

No duplication.

That doesn't work if you wanted to do this write while you already have
IRQs disabled for example.
