The code could do it differently: do the path walk and then, before acceptin=
g the result, walk back up and make sure the result is under the starting po=
int.

This is *not* a full solution, though, since a walk above the root gas side e=
ffects on timing, various caches, and possibly network traffic, so it=E2=80=99=
s open to Spectre-like attacks in which a malicious container could use a ru=
ntime-initiated AT_THIS_ROOT to infer the existence of directories outside t=
he container.

But what=E2=80=99s the container usecase?  Any sane container is based on pi=
vot_root or similar, so the runtime can just do the walk in the container co=
ntext. IOW I=E2=80=99m a bit confused as to the exact intended use of the wh=
ole series. Can you elaborate?=
