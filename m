You are right, I concede this part of the argument - what you describe is probably 
the most typical way to get ro-faults.

I do maintain the (sub-)argument that oopsing or relying on tooling help years 
down the line is vastly inferior to fixing up the problem and generating a 
one-time stack dump so that kernel developers have a chance to fix the bug. The 
sooner we detect and dump such information the more likely it is that such bugs 
don't get into end user kernel versions.

Yes, you are right and I agree.

Does anyone want to submit such a patch for upstream? Looks like a good change.

Thanks,
