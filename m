Right, and for keys which are readable (but not writable) most of the 
time, so that date is readable, this breaks things.

The interface is not specific to XSAVE.  To generic code, only the two 
signal mask manipulation functions are exposed.  And I expect that we're 
going to need that for other (non-x86) implementations because they will 
have the same issue because the signal handler behavior will be identical.

Thanks,
