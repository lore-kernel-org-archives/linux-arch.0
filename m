Memory protection keys enables an application to protect its address
space from inadvertent access by its own code.

This feature is now enabled on powerpc and has been available since
4.16-rc1. The patches move the selftests to arch neutral directory
and enhance their test coverage.

Testing
-------
Verified for correctness on powerpc. Need help with x86 testing as I
do not have access to a Skylake server. Client platforms like Coffee
Lake do not have the required feature bits set in CPUID.

Changelog
---------
Link to previous version (v14):
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=55981&state=*

v15:
	(1) Rebased on top of latest master.
	(2) Addressed review comments from Dave Hansen.
	(3) Moved code for getting or setting pkey bits to new
	    helpers. These changes replace patch 7 of v14.
	(4) Added a fix which ensures that the correct count of
	    reserved keys is used across different platforms.
	(5) Added a fix which ensures that the correct page size
	    is used as powerpc supports both 4K and 64K pages.

v14:
	(1) Incorporated another round of comments from Dave Hansen.

v13:
	(1) Incorporated comments for Dave Hansen.
	(2) Added one more test for correct pkey-0 behavior.

v12:
	(1) Fixed the offset of pkey field in the siginfo structure for
	    x86_64 and powerpc. And tries to use the actual field
	    if the headers have it defined.

v11:
	(1) Fixed a deadlock in the ptrace testcase.

v10 and prior:
	(1) Moved the testcase to arch neutral directory.
	(2) Split the changes into incremental patches.
