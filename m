So changes to Documentation/features/ should come as simple patches done from hand 
editing, there's no need to preserve any initial (half-)automated generation. 
Formatting should be preserved so that Documentation/features/list-arch.sh still 
works as before.

Jon: would you like to receive all patches to Documentation/features/ so you can 
collect them in the documentation tree, or can maintainers patch it as part of any 
feature work that affects the tables? I think it's all finegrained enough to not 
create conflicts. That way they would become partly self-maintaining. (Or at least 
one can always hope! ;-)

Thanks,

	Ingo
