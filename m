Ok, agreed, I've solved these problems by creating a per feature 
broken out directory hieararchy, see my next patch submission.

Yes.

Ok, added.

Ok, added.

> __HAVE_ARCH_PTE_SPECIAL

Ok, added.

> __HAVE_ARCH_GATE_AREA

So this does not appear to be a feature per se: architectures that 
don't define __HAVE_ARCH_GATE_AREA fall back to the generic one. Or is 
it expected for every architecture to provide its own?

> ARCH_HAVE_ELF_ASLR

Does not seem to be upstream.

> ARCH_HAS_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL

Yeah, that's already included in v6.

> CONFIG_ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP

So AFAICS this feature is an arch opt-in, on the basis of whether GCC 
does the right thing or not.

We'd need a separate config switch: ARCH_DONT_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP to 
make a distinction between architectures that have made an informed 
decision to not support it, versus architectures that have not 
bothered so far.

> HAVE_ARCH_HUGE_VMAP

Ok, added.

> ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN

Ok, added.

> __HAVE_ARCH_STRNCASECMP

So, no architecture supports this yet- but added.

> ARCH_HAS_ELF_RANDOMIZE

Agreed and v6 already includes this.

> CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_EARLY_PFN_TO_NID

So this isn't really a feature, but a facility that an architecture 
might have to provide if it has a quirk. Only ia64 has that at the 
moment.

> ARCH_SUPPORTS_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT

Not upstream yet it appears.

> CONFIG_ARCH_USES_PG_UNCACHED

Ok, added.

> CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_WALK_MEMORY

So this too is a quirk, for PowerPC, which does not maintain the 
memory layout in the resource tree.

> HAVE_GENERIC_RCU_GUP

So this is a generic, RCU based fast-GUP facility - but architectures 
may implement their own get_user_pages_fast() facilites, such as x86 
which does it lock-less.

So I'm not sure what to flag here: perhaps architectures that don't 
offer get_user_pages_fast() at all?

> HAVE_RCU_TABLE_FREE

So this is related to HAVE_GENERIC_RCU_GUP: architectures that do RCU 
based GUP will want to use HAVE_RCU_TABLE_FREE.

> HAVE_GENERIC_RCU_GUP

double ;-)

> CONFIG_HAVE_CLK

So I think the generic clock framework first needs to be integrated 
with core timekeeping before we start requiring it from architectures.

> CONFIG_HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT

Agreed - already in -v6.

> CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP

Ok, added.

Hm, yes. If you give me a rough list then I can try to map them out as 
well.

Once we have the initial feature collection done it will be a lot 
easier going forward: anything missing or inaccurate can be added to 
or fixed in its own file.

I hope you'll like the structure of -v7 better :-)

Thanks,
