Please make an effort to un-Intel-ificate your messages as much as
possible.  I'd really prefer that folks say "missing end branch fault"
rather than #CP.  I had to Google "#CP".

I *think* you are saying that:  The *only* lookups to this bitmap are on
"missing end branch" conditions.  Normal, proper-functioning code
execution that has ENDBR instructions in it will never even look at the
bitmap.  The only case when we reference the bitmap locations is when
the processor is about do do a "missing end branch fault" so that it can
be suppressed.  Any population with the zero page would be done when
code had already encountered a "missing end branch" condition, and
populating with a zero-filled page will guarantee that a "missing end
branch fault" will result.  You're arguing that we should just figure
this out at fault time and not ever reach the "missing end branch fault"
at all.

Is that right?

If so, that's an architecture subtlety that I missed until now and which
went entirely unmentioned in the changelog and discussion up to this
point.  Let's make sure that nobody else has to walk that path by
improving our changelog, please.

In any case, I don't think this is worth special-casing our zero-fill
code, FWIW.  It's not performance critical and not worth the complexity.
 If apps want to handle the signals and abuse this to fill space up with
boring page table contents, they're welcome to.  There are much easier
ways to consume a lot of memory.

Even for apps with 57-bit address spaces?

The bitmap size is determined by CR4.LA57, not the app.  If you place
the bitmap here, won't references to it for high addresses go into the
high address space?

Specifically, on a CR4.LA57=0 system, we have 48 bits of address space,
so 128TB for apps.  You are proposing sticking the bitmap above the
stack which is near the top of that 128TB address space.  But on a
5-level paging system with CR4.LA57=1, there could be valid data at
129GB.  Is there something keeping that data from being mistaken for
being part of the bitmap?

Also, if you're limiting it to TASK_SIZE_LOW, please don't forget that
this is yet another thing that probably won't work with the vsyscall
page.  Please make sure you consider it and mention it in your next post.

What is this accounting problem?
