Based on the earlier threads where I tried to end the bikeshedding, it
seemed like MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE was the least bad option.

I'd like to hear feedback from Michael Kerrisk, as he's had to deal
with these kinds of choices in the past. I'm fine to ask Linus too. I
just want to get past the name since the feature is quite valuable.

And if Michal doesn't want to touch this patch any more, I'm happy to
do the search/replace/resend. :P
