i don't see the compile time vs. runtime detection as 'competing' approaches,
both have their own role. in general, i think it's safe to say that compile
time problem detection is preferred to the runtime one since it subjects less
users to the side effects of the bug. runtime detection is needed to augment
(even complete) the coverage that compile time detection may not be able to
provide.

that said, for __read_only related problems the compiler can actually do a
pretty good job, basically it could detect most of them except special cases
where the 'bad' write is somehow hidden from it. the only examples i recall
are like the one that Mathias already mentioned where the 'bad' write was
done from asm code or out-of-kernel code (think UEFI runtime services) that
is obviously not visible to the compiler (the resume/mmu_cr4_features problem
also happens to be an example where runtime detection did not help due to the
circumstances).

so let me summarize how i expect the runtime detection part to work:

1. in normal use any write attempt to read-only kernel data should only
   be reported as usual (the oops info already has rip/cr2/backtrace),
   but no smart recovery attempts should be made since they may end up
   actually helping a real exploit attempt.

2. if necessary for debugging purposes (i.e., when the above reporting
   mechanism didn't produce the necessary logs and the problem is
   reproducible and wasn't an attack), a kernel command line option can
   be used to make an attempt at smart recovery instead of oopsing (but
   the same information would still be reported of course).

   for this smart recovery we differ(ed?) in opinion, i say that allowing
   the write in this case (vs. ignoring it) is the least likely to introduce
   a logic bug (and its cascading effects) since the expected problem is
   to be case #1 or #2 above (i.e., the write is intended but prevented
   by __read_only).
