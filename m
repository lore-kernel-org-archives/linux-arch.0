Why not? On saturation the object will leak and returning a reference to
it is always good.

I don't see it as bizarre, we turned an overflow/use-after-free into a
leak. That's the primary mechanism here.

As long as we have a reference to a leaked object, we might as well use
it, its not going anywhere.

It changes the semantics between inc_not_zero() and inc(). It also
complicates the semantics of inc_not_zero(), where currently the failure
implies the count is 0 and means no-such-object, you complicate matters
by basically returning 'busy'.

That is a completely new class of failure that is actually hard to deal
with, not to mention that it completely destroys refcount_inc_not_zero()
being a 'simple' replacement for atomic_inc_not_zero().

In case of the current failure, the no-such-object, we can fix that by
creating said object. But what to do on 'busy' ? Surely you don't want
to create another. You'd have to somehow retrofit something to wait on
in every user.
