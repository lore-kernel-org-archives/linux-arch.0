Huh?  Doesn't this have to be per mm?  Sure, PKRU is per thread, but
the page tables are shared.

My vote would be to keep the allocation mechanism but get rid of pkey_set.

Also, I think the debug poisoning feature is overcomplicated.  Let's
just forbid mprotect_key with an unallocated key.

There are still two issues that I think we need to address, though:

1. Signal delivery shouldn't unconditionally clear PKRU.  That's what
the current patches do, and it's unsafe.  I'd rather set PKRU to the
maximally locked down state on signal delivery (except for the
PROT_EXEC key), although that might cause its own set of problems.

2. When thread A allocates a pkey, how does it lock down thread B?

#2 could be addressed by using fully-locked-down as the initial state
post-exec() and copying the state on clone().  Dave, are there any
cases in practice where one thread would allocate a pkey and want
other threads to immediately have access to the memory with that key?

I find myself wondering whether we should stop using XSAVE for PKRU
sooner rather than later.  If we do anything like the above, we
completely lose the init optimization, and the code would be a good
deal simpler if we switched PKRU directly in switch_to and could
therefore treat it like a normal register everywhere else.
