Okay, this model is really quite different from x86.  Is there a good 
reason for the difference?  Could we change the x86 implementation to 
behave in the same way?  Or alternatively, change the POWER 
implementation to match the existing x86 behavior?

The existing x86 interface defaults to resetting the bits, 
unfortunately.  I'm not sure if we can or should change this now.

For my purposes, the POWER semantics would work fine as far as I can 
see.  The reset-to-default is really problematic.  I don't actually need 
the configurable behavior, but I implemented it this way to achieve a 
maximum of backwards compatibility.

Thanks,
