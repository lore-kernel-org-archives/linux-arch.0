I really cannot tell but I never ever saw this before and i'm using all o=
f my patches for several years. Here are all patches which i'm using righ=
t now (+ your patch):
http://watchdog.sk/lkml/patches3




>Are there OOM kill messages in the syslog?



Here is full kernel log between 6:00 and 7:59:
http://watchdog.sk/lkml/kern6.log

t with the newest one.

I meant, the problem above occured on kernel with your latest patch:
http://watchdog.sk/lkml/7-2-memcg-fix.patch

but after i had to reboot the server i booted the kernel with your previo=
us patch:
http://watchdog.sk/lkml/7-1-memcg-fix.patch
