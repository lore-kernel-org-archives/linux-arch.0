+Introduction
+============
+
+LKL (Linux Kernel Library) is aiming to allow reusing the Linux kernel code as
+extensively as possible with minimal effort and reduced maintenance overhead.
+
+Examples of how LKL can be used are: creating userspace applications (running on
+Linux and other operating systems) that can read or write Linux filesystems or
+can use the Linux networking stack, creating kernel drivers for other operating
+systems that can read Linux filesystems, bootloaders support for reading/writing
+Linux filesystems, etc.
+
+With LKL, the kernel code is compiled into an object file that can be directly
+linked by applications. The API offered by LKL is based on the Linux system call
+interface.
+
+LKL is implemented as one of the mode of UML (arch/um). It uses host operations
+defined by the application or a host library (tools/lkl/lib).
+
+
+Supported hosts
+===============
+
+The supported host for now is Linux (x86 architecture) userspace applications.
+
+
+Building LKL the host library and LKL applications
+==================================================
+
+    $ make -C tools/lkl
+
+will build LKL as a object file, it will install it in tools/lkl/lib together
+with the headers files in tools/lkl/include then will build the host library,
+tests and a few of application examples:
+
+* tests/boot - a simple applications that uses LKL and exercises the basic LKL
+  APIs
+
+* tests/net-test - a simple applications that uses network feature of LKL and
+  exercises the basic network-related APIs
+
+* fs2tar - a tool that converts a filesystem image to a tar archive
+
+* cptofs/cpfromfs - a tool that copies files to/from a filesystem image
+
+* lklfuse - a tool that can mount a filesystem image in userspace,
+  without root privileges, using FUSE
+
+
+Building LKL on Ubuntu
+-----------------------
+
+    $ sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev libarchive-dev xfsprogs
+
+    # Optional, if you would like to be able to run tests
+    $ sudo apt-get install btrfs-tools
+    $ pip install yamlish junit_xml
+
+    $ make -C tools/lkl
+
+    # To check that everything works:
+    $ cd tools/lkl
+    $ make run-tests
