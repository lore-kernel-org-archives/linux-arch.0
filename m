On the glibc side, we see a lot of changes in error codes depending on 
kernel version, build and run-time configuration.  It never occurred to 
me that you guys think the precise error code is part of the userspace 
ABI.  Personally, I even assume that failure itself can disappear at any 
time (evidence: the f* functions which accept O_PATH in their non-*at 
variants).
