This shouldn=E2=80=99t be able to OOPS because it only happens at CPL 3, rig=
ht?  We should put it into core dumps, though.

Given that the format depends on the VA size, this might be a good idea.  I b=
et we can reuse the special mapping infrastructure for this =E2=80=94 the VM=
A could
be a MAP_PRIVATE special mapping named [cet_legacy_bitmap] or similar, and w=
e can even make special rules to core dump it intelligently if needed.  And w=
e can make mremap() on it work correctly if anyone (CRIU?) cares.

Hmm.  Can we be creative and skip populating it with zeros?  The CPU should o=
nly ever touch a page if we miss an ENDBR on it, so, in normal operation, we=
 don=E2=80=99t need anything to be there.  We could try to prevent anyone fr=
om *reading* it outside of ENDBR tracking if we want to avoid people acciden=
tally wasting lots of memory by forcing it to be fully populated when the re=
ad it.

The one downside is this forces it to be per-mm, but that seems like a gener=
ally reasonable model anyway.

This also gives us an excellent opportunity to make it read-only as seen fro=
m userspace to prevent exploits from just poking it full of ones before redi=
recting execution.=
