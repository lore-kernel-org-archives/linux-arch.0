Yeah, so (as you probably guessed!) I'm starting to have second thoughts =
about the=20
complexity of the alloc/free/set/get interface I suggested, and Mel's rev=
iew=20
certainly strengthened that feeling.

I have two worries:

1)

A technical worry I have is that the 'pkey allocation interface' does not=
 seem to=20
be taking the per thread property of pkeys into account - while that prop=
erty=20
would be useful for apps. That is a limitation that seems unjustified.

The reason for this is that we are storing the key allocation bitmap in s=
truct_mm,=20
in mm->context.pkey_allocation_map - while we should be storing it in tas=
k_struct=20
or thread_info.

We could solve this by moving the allocation bitmap to the task struct, b=
ut:

2)

My main worry is that it appears at this stage that we are still pretty f=
ar away=20
from completely shadowing the hardware pkey state in the kernel - and wit=
hout that=20
we cannot really force user-space to use the 'proper' APIs. They can just=
 use the=20
raw instructions, condition them on a CPUID and be done with it: everythi=
ng can be=20
organized in user-space.

Furthermore, implementing it in a high performance fashion would be prett=
y complex=20
- at minimum we'd have to register a per thread read-write user-space dat=
a area=20
where the kernel could store pkeys management data so that vsyscalls can =
access it=20
... None of that facility exists today.

And without vsyscall optimizations user-space might legitimately use its =
own=20
implementation for performance reasons and we'd end up with twice the com=
plexity=20
and a largely unused piece of kernel infrastructure ...

So how about the following minimalistic approach instead, to get the ball=
 rolling=20
without making ABI decisions we might regret:

 - There are 16 pkey indices on x86 currently. We already use index 15 fo=
r the=20
   true PROT_EXEC implementation. Let's set aside another pkey index for =
the=20
   kernel's potential future use (index 14), and clear it explicitly in t=
he=20
   FPU context on every context switch if CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU is enabled=
 to make=20
   sure it remains unallocated.

 - Expose just the new mprotect_pkey() system call to install a pkey inde=
x into=20
   the page tables - but we let user-space organize its key allocations.

 - Give user-space an idea about limits:

     "ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS=E2=80=94EXCEPT EUROPA ATTEMPT NO LANDING=
 THERE"

   Ooops, wrong one. Lets try this instead:

     Expose the current maximum user-space usable pkeys index in some
     programmatically accessible fashion. Maybe mprotect_pkey() could rej=
ect a=20
     permanently allocated kernel pkey index via a distinctive error code=
?

   I.e. this pattern:

     ret =3D pkey_mprotect(NULL, PAGE_SIZE, real_prot, pkey);

   ... would validate the pkey and we'd return -EOPNOTSUPP for pkey that =
is not=20
   available? This would allow maximum future flexibility as it would not=
 define=20
   kernel allocated pkeys as a 'range'.

 - ... and otherwise leave the remaining 14 pkey indices for user-space t=
o manage.

If in the future user-space pkeys usage grows to such a level that kernel=
=20
arbitration becomes desirable then we can still implement the get/set/all=
oc/free=20
system calls as well: the first use of those system calls would switch on=
 the=20
kernel's pkey management facilities and from that point on user-space is =
supposed=20
to use the published system calls only. Applications using pkey instructi=
ons=20
directly would still work just fine: they'd never use the new system call=
s.

I.e. we can actually keep a bigger ABI flexibility by introducing the sim=
plest=20
possible ABI at this stage. Maybe user-space usage of this hardware featu=
re will=20
never grow beyond that simple ABI - in which case we've saved quite a bit=
 of=20
ongoing maintenance complexity...

And yes, I realize that we've come a full round since the very first vers=
ion of=20
this patch set, but I think the extra hoops were still worth it, because =
the=20
true-PROT_EXEC feature came out of it which is very useful IMHO. But my m=
ore=20
complex pkey management syscall ideas don't seem to be all that useful an=
ymore.

So what do you think about this direction? This would simplify the patch =
set quite=20
a bit and would touch very little MM code beyond the mprotect_pkey() bits=
.

Thanks,

	Ingo
