The problem with the above is that we can't tell the difference
between pread2() returning a short read because the pages are not
in cache, or because someone truncated the file. So we need some
way to differentiate this.

My preference from userspace would be for pread2() to return
EAGAIN if *all* the data requested is not available (where
'all' can be less than the size requested if the file has
been truncated in the meantime).

So:

ret = pread2(fd, buf, size_wanted, RWF_NONBLOCK)

if (ret == -1) {
	if (errno == EAGAIN) {
		goto threadpool...
	}
	.. real error..
}

if (ret == size_wanted) {
	.. normal read, file not truncated...
}

if (ret < size_wanted) {
	.. file was truncated..
}

The thing I want to avoid is the case where
ret < size_wanted means only part of the file
is in cache.
