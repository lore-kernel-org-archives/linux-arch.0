I copied everyone who had put this into a defconfig and I will wait a
little more to see if anyone screams.  I think it is a safe guess that
several of the affected configurations are dead (or at least
unmaintained) as I received 17 bounces when copying everyone.

I would make it a followup that removes uapi/linux/sysctl.h.  I don't
see anything in it that isn't about the sysctl system call.  I will keep
it a separate patch as I can imagine something silly that needs the
header file to compile.  A separate patch would make a revert easier
if we find something like that.
