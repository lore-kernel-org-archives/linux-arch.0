The thread inheritance of PKRU can be nice.  It actually gives things a
good chance of working if you can control PKRU before clone().  I'd
describe the semantics like this:

	PKRU values are inherited at the time of a clone() system
	call.  Threads unaware of protection keys may work on
	protection-key-protected data as long as PKRU is set up in
	advance of the clone() and never needs to be changed inside the
	thread.

	If a thread is created before PKRU is set appropriately, the
	thread may not be able to act on protection-key-protected data.

Otherwise, the semantics are simpler, but they basically give threads no
chance of ever working:

	Threads unaware of protection keys and which can not manage
	PKRU may not operate on data where a non-zero key has been
	passed to pkey_mprotect().

It isn't clear to me that one of these is substantially better than the
other.  It's fairly easy in either case for an app that cares to get the
behavior of the other.

But, one is clearly easier to implement in the kernel. :)

Yeah, doable, but not without some new data going out to userspace, plus
the vsyscall code itself.

The point is still that wrpkru destroyed the 'push' operation.  You
always end up with a PKRU that (at least temporarily) ignored the 'push'.
