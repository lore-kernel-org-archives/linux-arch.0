In the "Forward Looking" section there's a description of why we want
pwritev2 and what we're doing to do with it in the future. The goal is
to have two additional flags for those calls RWF_DSYNC and
RWF_NONBLOCK. As Christop mentioned modern network filesystem
protocols have per operation sync flags. And there's use cases for
guaranteeing of write dirtying pages without triggering a writeout.

The consensus from our discussion at LSF fs tack was 1) that both
preadv and pwritev should have flags to begin with, inline with the
API syscall design guidelines 2) if we're adding preadv2 we should add
a matching pwritev2 3) especially that we plan on introducing further
flags to preadv in the near future.

In a much earlier patch series we already had the discussion on why we
can't use O_NONBLOCK for regular files. It comes down to that it
breaks some userspace applications. Link for further reference to the
thread:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/22/294
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.aio.general/4242

I will include the background in the next patchset.

Sync is the samba mode where we do not use threadpool just service the
IO request in the network thread. In a single client case if
everything is in the page cache we are aiming to be as close in
latency as sync. The reason it isn't is because the threadpool path in
samba has some additional over head. I did bring it up to the Samba
folks on their technical mailing list, they can investigate it further
if they want it.

It's impractical to use Sync anywhere we have modern SMB3 clients that
can multiplex > 100 operations over a single connection. Head-of-line
blocking would kill performance, why we need the threadpool. With the
threadpool we increase the mean (and tail) latency even if the data is
handy and we can answer it right away.

The cifs FIO engine that I wrote
https://github.com/mtanski/fio/commits/samba does not let us multiplex
multiple SMB3 request. That's not exposed in the samba client
libraries.

The RWF_NONBLOCK is aimed primarily at network applications. Some of
them can send a partial result down the network, and then they can
enqueue the rest in the threadpool. For applications that need the
whole value, they clearly have to wait to read in the rest, but it's
behavior that are opting into.

I see fincore() and preadv2() with RWF_NONBLOCK as tangential
syscalls. You can implement a poor man's RWF_NONBLOCK in userspace
with fincore() but not all of us are fine with it's racy nature or
requiring 2 syscalls in the best case.
