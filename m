s/primitizes/primitives

also, the 'faster runtime' and the whole explanation reads a bit weird to me,
how about something like:

       An architecture selects this when it has implemented refcount_t
       using open coded assembly primitives that provide an optimized
       refcount_t implementation, possibly at the expense of some full
       refcount state checks of CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL=y.

       The refcount overflow check behavior, however, must be retained.
       Catching overflows is the primary security concern for protecting
       against bugs in reference counts.

Just wonderin, how was the 32-bit kernel tested?

I had to read this 4 times to parse it (and even now I'm unsure whether I parsed 
it correctly) - could this explanation be transformed to simpler, more 
straightforward English?

Would it be technically possible to use named labels instead of these random 
numbered labels?

Small nit: 'ZF' stands for 'zero flag' - so we should either write 'zero flag' or 
'ZF' - 'ZF flag' is kind of redundant.

By now you should know that for x86 code you should not break lines in such an 
ugly fashion, right? :-)

Thanks,
