This one feels like something that can or should be implemented in
glibc.

There is no real enforcement of the values yet looking them up or
setting them takes mmap_sem for write. Applications that frequently get
called will get hammed into the ground with serialisation on mmap_sem
not to mention the cost of the syscall entry/exit.

RIght now, I'm seeing a lot of cost and not much benefit with this
specific patch.
