Is that really better than doing it in-kernel?  My concern is that
we'll find library code that creates a thread, and that code could run
before the pkey-aware part of the program even starts running.  So how
is user code supposed lock down all of its threads?

seccomp has TSYNC for this, but I don't think that PKRU allows
something like that.
