I agree, it would be better to merge them.

My concern was that the correct way to get these definitions from
userspace is very unclear, so there may be software out there
including <asm/auxvec.h> directly, which would now lack expected
definitions.

codesearch.debian.net shows no real hits for that, so maybe I'm too
paranoid.

Since <linux/auxvec.h> only contains #defines, it may be enough for arch
<asm/auxvec.h> headers to include <linux/auxvec.h>.

Thoughts?
