Disagree.  What is better: having _one_ _common_ argument order in the
syscall interface, or having architectures end up doing their own thing?

Think about your strace argument - you're effectively requiring strace
to know that on architecture X, the syscall argument order is X1, but
on architecture Y, that same syscall has argument order Y1, and maybe
architecture Z, it's again a different order Z1.

That _adds_ complexity to strace - rather than having one ordering to
deal with for a syscall, it now has three different random orders.

That's completely insane.  With one _common_ ordering, at least strace
has the possibility of cleanly sorting it out.
