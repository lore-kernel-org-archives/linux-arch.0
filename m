Because:
	a) EUCLEAN is horrible for code documentation. EFSCORRUPTED
	describes exactly the error being returned and/or checked for.

	b) we've used EFSCORRUPTED in XFS since 1993. i.e. it was an
	official, published error value on Irix, and we've kept it
	in the linux code for the past ~20 years because of a)

	c) Userspace programs that include filesystem specific
	headers have already been exposed to and use EFSCORRUPTED,
	so we can't remove/change it without breaking userspace.

	d) EUCLEAN has a convenient userspace string description
	that is appropriate for filesystem corruption: "Structure
	needs cleaning" is precisely what needs to happen. Repair of
	the filesystem (i.e. recovery to a clean state) is what is
	required to fix the error....

> b) Perhaps both errors should use different values?

That horse bolted to userspace years ago - this is just formalising
the practice that has spread across multiple linux filesystems from
XFS over the past ~10 years..

Cheers,

Dave.
