Don't you think the generic find_zero() is likely just as fast as the
pop count instruction? On 32-bit, I think it's like a shift and a mask
and a couple of additions.

The 64-bit case has a multiply that is likely expensive unless you
have a good multiplication unit (but what 64-bit architecture
doesn't?), but the generic 32-bit LE code should already be pretty
close to optimal, and it might not be worth it to worry about it.

(The big-endian case is very different, and architectures really can
do much better. But LE allows for bit tricks using the carry chain)
