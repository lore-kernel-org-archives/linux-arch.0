The interesting case for fexecve is when we either don't know what files
are present or we don't want to depend on which files are present.

As Al pointed out d_path really isn't the right solution.  It fails when
printing /proc/self/fd/${fd}/${filename->name} would work, and the
"(deleted)" or "(unreachable)" strings are wrong.

The test for today's cases should be:
if ((filename->name[0] == '/') || fd == AT_FDCWD) {
	bprm->filename = filename->name;
} 

To handle the case where the file descriptor is relevant.

For the case where the file descriptor is relevant let me suggest
setting bprm->filename and bprm->interp to:

/dev/fd/${fd}/${filename->name}

It is more a description of what we have done but as a magic string it
is descriptive.  Documetation/devices.txt documents that /dev/fd/ should
exist, making it an unambiguous path.  Further these days the kernel
sets the device naming policy in dev, so I think we are strongly safe in
using that path in any event.

I think execveat is interesting in the kernel because the motivating
cases are the cases where anything except a static executable is
uninteresting.

Now it has been suggested creating a dupfs or a mini-proc.  I think that
sounds like a nice companion, to the concept of a locked down root.
But I don't think it removes the need for execveat (because we still
have the case where we don't want to care what is mounted, and are happy
to use static executables).
