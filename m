That just avoids the need for preprocessor conditionals in the middle of
copy_process, and allows copy_process to start accepting the tls
argument from sys_clone.  The version passed to sys_clone via C is not
actually used unless the architecture opts into HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS.

That's not the only change every arch would need; they'd need to
actually pass it correctly from their arch-specific syscall entry point
into sys_clone, which not all architectures do.  (x86, for instance, did
not.)

All architectures should, eventually, but just as many architectures
don't wire up new syscalls right away, not all architectures will opt in
at the same time.  And you're already suggesting that architectures
won't actually convert right away:

I don't like to introduce new warnings.  And without the new Kconfig
symbol, there's nothing to depend on to ensure that the target
architecture has fixed this.  CONFIG_CLONE4 needs to depend on
CONFIG_HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS, for instance, because it'll be broken
otherwise.

They're on LKML in the clone4 thread; see
