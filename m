Yep, that was the one.  At that point, the CPU can disappear without
any chance to tell RCU anything, so RCU has to have started ignoring
it beforehand.  This bug has existed for a long time, masked by RCU's
waiting a jiffy before ignoring already-offline CPUs.  Which would be a
problem if the CPU took longer than one jiffy to get from stop_machine()
to arch_cpu_idle_dead().  Which could actually, happen, especially
in a guest OS.

In addition, any tracing or printk()s on that code path (for example,
via lockdep) can also result in RCU read-side critical sections from an
offline CPU that RCU is ignoring.

So you would like me to pull this info into the commit log?  Easy to
do if so.

Or am I missing your point?

							Thanx, Paul
