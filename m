Right, having a deterministic protection (checking for overflow) is
best since it stops all exploits using that path. Hoping that an
attacker is unlucky and hits a notification after they've already
landed their corruption is not a very useful defense. It certainly has
a non-zero value, but stopping overflow 100% is better. Especially
when we can do it with no meaningful change in performance which lets
us actually do the atomic_t -> refcount_t conversion everywhere.
