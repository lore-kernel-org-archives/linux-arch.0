A typical pattern for the usage count is caches, where objects are kept
in a data structure (hash/tree and/or list) and we count how many users
there are of said objects. A GC or shrinker will then iterate the
structure and prune those objects that have 0 users.

It is fairly straight forward to convert those to refcount_t by adding
one reference for the data structure itself. The GC/shrinker will then
have to use something like refcount_dec_if_one() to drop the reference
from 1->0 (and we could easily add something like dec_and_lock_if_one if
so desired).

Not all of them mind you, but simple cases can certainly be done without
too much pain.

But clearly there have been conversions of less than desired quality /
clarity though ...
