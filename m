Presumably there will be instances where the maintainer decides "we
shall not implement that".

I suppose so.  Having a great bunch of directories, each containing a
single file is a bit odd.

It would be nice to provide people with commit IDs to look at, but the
IDs won't be known at the time the documentation file is created.  We
could provide patch titles.

But still, let's not overdo it - get something in there, see how well
it works, evolve it over time.

I don't think we've heard from any (non-x86) arch maintainers?  Do they
consider this useful at all?  Poke.
