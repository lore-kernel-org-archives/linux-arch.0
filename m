Don't worry about doing all architectures for the RFC, I mainly want this
to be done consistently by the time it gets into linux-next.

One thing to figure out though is whether we need the stack_size argument
that a couple of architectures pass. It's usually hardwired to zero,
but not all the time, and I don't know the history of this.
