	... and it fails on LOOKUP_BENEATH anyway.  Egads...  So that's for your
LOOKUP_CHROOT ;-/  IMO that's awful, especially with the way you've spread those
LOOKUP_CHROOT cases between these two.

	Why not simply have O_THISROOT pick root by dirfd and call file_open_root()?
And if something wants it for stat(), etc. just have them use it combined with
O_PATH and pass the result to ...at()...
