Fair enough.

Ok. I was fairly sure that was the thinking behind it but wanted to be suire.

Ok, it's not a major problem. I simply worried that the protection of
key slots is pretty weak as it can be interfered with from userspace.
On the other hand, the kernel never interprets the information so it's
unlikely to cause a security problem. Applications can still shoot
themselves in the foot but hopefully the developers are aware that the
protection they get with keys is not absolute.

Ok, that makes sense. I don't think it's goofy. Sure, they cannot detect
the CPU support directly from the interface but it's close enough.
