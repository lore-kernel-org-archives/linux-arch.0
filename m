Nope, the amd64 (that's what you have in mind with am64, not aarch64 right ?)
mode has the IP-relative has well, so x32 has no advantage over amd64 in this
area.

x32 over amd64 advantage is cache and memory footprint AFAICT, I don't see other
benefits. There doesn't seem to be any ISA differences, or I didn't really
notice in my daily system performance analysis job.

There was a nice presentation made by Peter Anvin at a Plumber conference, here

Cheers.
