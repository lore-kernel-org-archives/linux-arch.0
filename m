I think Andrew can do the s@MAP_FIXED_SAFE@MAP_$FOO@ when adding the
patch to the mmotm tree. The reason why I refuse to repost is that a)
functionality doesn't really need a further rework (at least not based
on the review feedback) and b) I do not really see any large consensus
here. People claim to like this or that more but nobody (except of you
Kees) was willing to put their name under their preference in a form of
Acked-by. And that worries me, because generating "better" names sounds
too easy to allow a forward progress.
