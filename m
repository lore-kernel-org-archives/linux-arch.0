With open_tree(2) and OPEN_TREE_CLONE, will O_BENEATH still be
necessary? As I understand it, O_BENEATH could be replaced by a much
simpler flag that only disallows absolute paths (incl. absolute
symlinks). And it would have the benefit that you can actually pass the
tree/directory fd to another process and escaping would not be possible
even if that other process doesn't use O_BENEATH (after calling
mount_setattr(2) to make sure it's locked down).

This approach would also make it easy to restrict writes via a cloned
tree/directory fd by marking it read-only via mount_setattr(2) (and
locking down the read-only flag). This would again be especially useful
when passing tree/directory fds across processes, or for voluntary
self-lockdown within a process for robustness against security bugs.

This wouldn't affect any of the other flags in this patch. And for full
equivalence to O_BENEATH you'd have to use O_NOMAGICLINKS in addition
to O_NOABSOLUTE, or whatever that new flag would be called.

Or is OPEN_TREE_CLONE too expensive for this use case? Or is there
anything else I'm missing?
