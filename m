AFAIU the threat is that you could potentially use variant 1 to get
speculative RIP control using the indirect call through the syscall
table. (I haven't tested myself whether that'd work, and I don't know
how well that would work especially when the limit for the comparison
is coming from an immediate, but apparently Dan thinks it's a
potential problem?)
In other words, this would again be an attack against the indirect
call "call *sys_call_table(, %rax, 8)", but this time, the attack
would rely on the indirect branch being resolved *properly* based on
the address read from memory instead of relying on a misprediction;
but using an index into the syscall array that is out of bounds, after
mispredicting the conditional jump for verifying that the syscall
number is in bounds. This could still work even with retpolines if the
CPU can correct mispredictions within speculative execution.
