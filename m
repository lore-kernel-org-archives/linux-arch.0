Well, it could if it tracked the pkey_alloc/pkey_free calls too. I accept
that's not perfect as nothing prevents the syscalls being used directly.

I accept the premature optimisation arguement but I think it'll eventually
bite us. Why this red-flagged for me was because so many people have
complained about just system call overhead when using particular types of
hardware -- DAX springs to mind with the MAP_PMEM_AWARE discussions. Using
mmap_sem means that pkey operations stop parallel faults, mmaps and so on. If
the applications that care are trying to minimise page table operations,
TLB flushes and so on, they might not be that happy if parallel faults
are stalled.

I think whether you serialise pkey_get/pkey_set operations or not, it's
going to be inherently racy with different sized windows. A sequence counter
would be sufficient to protect it to prevent partial reads. If userspace
cares about the race, then userspace is going to have to serialise its
threads access to the keys anyway.
