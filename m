Okay.  In the future, may want to use this access rights to specify the 
default for the signal handler (with a new pkey_alloc flag).  If I can 
the default access rights, that would pretty much solve the sigsetjmp 
problem for me, too, and I can start using protection keys in low-level 
glibc code.

I'm comparing this to munmap, which is actually such an antidote 
(because it involves an IPI to flush all CPUs which could have seen the 
mapping before).

I'm surprised that pkey_free doesn't perform a similar broadcast.

TLB flushes are complicated, too, and very costly, but we still do them 
on unmap, even in cases where they are not required for security reasons.

No, we want to the revocation to be immediate, so we'd have to use 
something like the setxid broadcast, and we have to make sure that we 
aren't in a pkey_set, and if we are, adjust register contents besides 
PKRU.  Not pretty at all.  I really don't want to implement that.

If the broadcast is lazy, I think it defeats its purpose because you 
don't know what kind of access privileges other threads in the system have.

Your solution to all MPK problems seems to be to say that it's undefined 
and applications shouldn't do that.  But if applications only used 
well-defined memory accesses, why would we need MPK?

Thanks,
Florian
