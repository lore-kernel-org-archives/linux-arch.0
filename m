Ok, thanks.

The theme of the review feedback on v1 was 'don't put ifence in any
net/ code', and that was addressed.

I honestly thought the new definition of array_ptr() changed the
calculus on this patch. Given the same pattern appears in the ipv6
case, and I have yet to hear that we should drop the ipv6 patch, make
the code symmetric just for readability purposes. Otherwise we need a
comment saying why this is safe for ipv4, but maybe not safe for ipv6,
I think 'array_ptr' is effectively that comment. I.e. 'array_ptr()' is
designed to be low impact for instrumenting false positives. If that
new argument does not hold water I will definitely drop this patch.
