Hmm I can see:

  /sys/devices/system/cpu

On both my x86 and arm64 systems - but I guess this is more ABIish than
CPU feature related.

Given the paucity of the /proc/sys/abi on both systems I guess this sort
of knob is rare enough that people haven't expressed a strong preference
for sysfs here. I have no objection to staying with /proc/sys/abi/.
