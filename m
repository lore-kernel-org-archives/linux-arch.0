Now we throw SIGSEGV when PF_SGX set, right? In my solution that would
be turned just doing iret to AEP with the extra that three registers get
exception data (type, reason, addr). No decoding or RIP adjusting
involved.

That would mean that you would actually have to implement AEP handler
than just have enclu there.

I've also proposed that perhaps for SGX also #UD should be propagated
this way because for some instructions you need outside help to emulate
"non-enclave" environment.

That is all I have drafted together so far. I'll try to finish v18 this
week with other stuff and refine further next week (unless someone gives
obvious reason why this doesn't work, which might well be because I
haven't went too deep with my analysis yet because of lack of time).
