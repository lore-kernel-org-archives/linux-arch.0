Uh... Ted?  Back in ~2009 we had a discussion on the ext4 conference
call about what error codes to return for "metadata is garbage" and
"metadata crc doesn't validate".  Back then you said that it would have
been great if someone had thought of defining error codes for that so
that by the time we got around to merging metadata checksums for ext4,
we'd have some error codes ready to go.

I pointed out that "the XFS people" already returned EUCLEAN /
EFSCORRUPTED and EILSEQ / EBADFSCRC for those cases and that upstream
had been doing that for a couple of years already, so we decided that
we'd just make ext4 behave like XFS because they'd already started
training everyone and their pet search engines that these oddly phrased
error messages in the context of a filesystem means they need to run
some sort of fsck/repair tool.  We also decided that while the messaging
was weird, it would be less work for both of us than to try to push
disruptive changes through Linux uapi, glibc, man pages, strerror
localization catalogs, etc.

Now it's a *decade* later, and ext4 / XFS have both converged on more or
less the same behavioral patterns w.r.t. when they return EFSCORRUPTED
and EFSBADCRC.  btrfs, hpfs, jffs2, and ubifs seem to use EUCLEAN to
signal bad metadata just like XFS and ext4 do.

I disagree with upending 13 years of established precedent for user
visible behavior.  We possibly could've pulled this off ten years ago,
but it's waaaay too late now.  Too much work, too little gain.
