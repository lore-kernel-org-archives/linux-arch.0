With my maintainer hat on, the kernel won't do that.  Obviously a
review of my parser would be appreciated, but I consider it to be
fully supported, just like glibc and musl's parsers are fully
supported.  Sadly, I *also* consider the version Go forked for a while
(now fixed) to be supported.  Sigh.
