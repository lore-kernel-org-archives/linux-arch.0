Essentially waitid(2) not waitid(3) has already seen this merger.
In that there is nothing to wait for that you can not already
expression with waitid.  status vs siginfo is a little different
but the information is encoded in both.

And waitid(2) optionally returns a struct rusage.

The only part where something is not parameterized in waitid is with the
return of rusage.

What to wait for takes an explicit type parameter.
What is being returned in siginfo returns an si_code to describe how
to decode it.

If it weren't for the zombie being gone after waitid returns I don't
think it would make any sense to combine getrusage and waitid together
at all.

The trouble with attributes is that means you can't filter your system
call arguments with seccomp.  Which most of the time is a pretty big
downside.


From what I have seen the only truly interesting case for extending
waitid is something file descriptor based so the parent/child
relationship is not necessary to wait for a process to terminate.

As for getrusage.  If a sane union of the rusage limits and cgroups or
something like cgroups could be devised.  That would be ideal.  Of
course except for the memory cgroups the similarity to the resource
usage measurments and limits really isn't there.  So I don't know if
merging them would be a real possibility.

So I suspect the simplest thing to do would be to set a flag in the
idtype member of waitid that says give me rusage64 and then we would
be done.  Alternately we could use the low bits of the resource usage
pointer.  Assuming we don't want to introduce another syscall that is.
I really don't see much incremental extensibility potential in the wait
or rusage interface right now.
