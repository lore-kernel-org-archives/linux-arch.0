It's entirely possible to have an application with a low / semi static
working set, and leave lots of free memory for the kernel especially
for the page cache. For example the Google want to minimize malloc().
So in tcmalloc() they grab large chunks and rarely release it to back
to the OS, in fact old version never shrank it. So you can entirely
avoid stalls in malloc() for many workloads.
