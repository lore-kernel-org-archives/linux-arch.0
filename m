The last sentence doesn't talk about MAP_FIXED. It talks about a hint
based mmap without MAP_FIXED ("there are others which would want to
enforce the given range but rather see a failure").

will remove the empty line

Copy&paste I guess, will update it.

Yes it seems I can. I would have to double check. It is true that
defining the new flag closer to MAP_FIXED makes some sense

OK, I will use this wording.

Thanks for your review! Finally something that doesn't try to beat the
