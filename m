That was my thinking: sysctls tend to control the kernel, especially
process behaviour, whereas /sys/ controls devices and subsystems.
That's not a concrete rule though and not written down, and doubtless a
major new set of sysctls would be shot down regardless of what they do.

Part of the problem with /proc is that people historically put things in
there that have random ad-hoc behaviour and semantics.  The sysctl
framework at least imposes some sanity here.

There is also some support for specialising sysctls to user namespaces,
which makes some sense in that /proc/sys/abi/* should probably be per-
container -- though whether it's ever considered important enough to
actually be implemented is another question.  I certainly don't attempt
to do it today.

I don't know how sysfs interacts with namespaces, but probably it can.

I guess I'll wait for someone to object loudly...
