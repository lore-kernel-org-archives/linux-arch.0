Thanks.  I may try to hack something in the meantime based on your
patch.

One other question: according to the draft spec at
https://github.com/hjl-tools/linux-abi/wiki/Linux-Extensions-to-gABI, it
looks like the .note.gnu.property section is supposed to be marked with
SHF_ALLOC in object files.

I think that means that the linker will map it with a PT_LOAD entry in
the program header table in addition to the PT_NOTE that describes the
location of the note.  I need to check what the toolchain actually
does.

If so, can we simply rely on the notes being already mapped, rather than
needing to do additional I/O on the ELF file to fetch the notes?

[...]
