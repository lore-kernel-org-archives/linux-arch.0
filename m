Yeah definitely. I guess I see the x86 version as a lower bound on the
semantics we'd need to implement and still claim to implement the
refcount stuff.

Yay!

Boo :/

Just kidding. I suspect you're right that we can probably pack a
reasonable amount of tests in the body of the LL/SC and not notice.

Heh yeah. Though I have looked at the code it generates on PPC and it's
not sleek, though I guess that's not a benchmark is it :)

cheers
