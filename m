I generally agree, except that glibc doesn't have any visibility into
whether a pkey is currently valid or not.

There are checks for mm_pkey_is_allocated().  That's the main thing
these syscalls add on top of the raw instructions.

I think we can do both of them without mmap_sem, as long as we resign
ourselves to this just being fundamentally racy (which it is already, I
think).  But, is it worth performance-tuning things that we don't expect
performance-sensitive apps to be using in the first place?  They'll just
use the RDPKRU/WRPKRU instructions directly.

Ingo, do you still feel strongly that these syscalls (pkey_set/get())
should be included?  Of the 5, they're definitely the two with the
weakest justification.
