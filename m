Why do some architectures need special cases here? I'd prefer to have
new system calls always get defined in a way that avoids this, and
have a common entry point for everyone.

Looking at the m68k sys_clone comment in
arch/m68k/kernel/process.c, it seems that this was done as an
optimization to deal with an inferior ABI. Similar code is present
in h8300, ia64, nios2, and sparc. If all of them just do this to
shave off a few cycles from the system call entry, I really
couldn't care less.
