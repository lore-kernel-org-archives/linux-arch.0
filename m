For this reason, I propose every new syscall that has flags to follow a
bitmask scheme, where any flag assigned a bit in the upper half returns
EOPNOTSUPP when called on an old kernel.  That would allow defining which
flags can be safely ignored and which can't.

It otherwise takes major hacks to implement a fail-if-not-supported flag
while keeping compat with old kernels.  For example, for mmap(), MAP_SHARED
has been duplicated as MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE just to allow an unrelated flag
(MAP_SYNC) to fail on old kernels.
