I cut the RISC-V stuff, but I intend to reply to it later.  As you
said, it's just a different topic.

It turns out there was actually a header checking script
(scripts/headers_check.pl), and it already had a check for this.  The
check was just disabled because there was "too much noise".  Rather
than putting it in headers_install I've just fixed that script.  I'm
definately lacking in perl powers, so I have no idea if what I've done
is sane.  Specifically: there's a global variable and a line over 80
characters, but since there's a bunch of other violations I figure
it's fine.

OK.  I think this has turned into more of a RFC than a PATCH,
though...  I've just #ifdef'd things for now to reduce the diff size,
though I think it might be cleaner to move some of them to the
non-user headers (ep_take_care_of_epollwakeup(), USE_WCACHING,
MAX_RAW_MINORS).

I'm pretty far out of my depth here, so these should all be carefully
considered, but there's a few that scare me more ("struct
elf_prstatus", "enum by_type_idx", AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH).  I think
there's only one actual bug here (MAP_UNINITIALIZED), the rest just
quiet the checking script.  Each patch has my rationale for what I
did.

Since this touches a whole lot of stuff, I've added a whole bunch of
CCs.
