We also don't know whether the application is going to use SVE or not,
so MINSIGSTKSZ could be just fine. I don't have a better idea here
without the last two RFC patches. So just ignore my comment.

I agree that in general the kernel always needs to provide user space
with FPSIMD_MAGIC. I was wondering whether on sigreturn the kernel may
choose not to enforce this. But I'm not sure we have a scenario where it
actually matters (IIUC set/getcontext is done in user space anyway).
