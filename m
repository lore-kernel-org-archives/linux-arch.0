Yes, and Alexei as well.

Ingo, I love you, but please take the incredulity down a bit,
especially when I had 'nospec' in all the names in v1. Thomas, Peter,
and Alexei wanted s/nospec_barrier/ifence/ and
s/array_idx_nospec/array_idx/. You can always follow on with a patch
to fix up the names and placements to your liking. While they'll pick
on my name choices, they won't pick on yours, because I simply can't
be bothered to care about a bikeshed color at this point after being
bounced around for 5 revisions of this patch set.
