I can see this working well for the 47-bit addressing default, but
what about applications that actually rely on 39-bit addressing
(I'd have to double-check, but I think this was the limit that
people were most interested in for arm64)?

39 bits seems a little small to make that the default for everyone
who doesn't pass the extra flag. Having to pass another flag to
limit the addresses introduces other problems (e.g. mmap from
library call that doesn't pass that flag).

For "personality-like", it would still have to interact
with the existing PER_LINUX32 and PER_LINUX32_3GB flags that
do the exact same thing, so actually using personality might
be better.

We still have a few bits in the personality arguments, and
we could combine them with the existing ADDR_LIMIT_3GB
and ADDR_LIMIT_32BIT flags that are mutually exclusive by
definition, such as

        ADDR_LIMIT_32BIT =      0x0800000, /* existing */
        ADDR_LIMIT_3GB   =      0x8000000, /* existing */
        ADDR_LIMIT_39BIT =      0x0010000, /* next free bit */
        ADDR_LIMIT_42BIT =      0x8010000,
        ADDR_LIMIT_47BIT =      0x0810000,
        ADDR_LIMIT_48BIT =      0x8810000,

This would probably take only one or two personality bits for the
limits that are interesting in practice.
