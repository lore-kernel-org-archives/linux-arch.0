But in looking at that first patch set, I don't see many, if any, that
could be solved with your proposal of copy_from_user_struct().  The two
networking patches couldn't, the scsi one was just bizarre (seriously,
you had to trust the input from the hardware, if not, there's worse
things happening), and the networking drivers were dealing with other
data streams I think.

So while I love the idea of copy_from_user_struct(), I don't see it as
any type of "this will solve the issues we are trying to address here"
solution :(

I've been emailing the Coverity people recently about this, and they
say they are close to having a ruleset/test that can identify this data
pattern better than the original tool that Intel and others came up
with.  But as I haven't seen the output of it yet, I have no idea if
that's true or not.  Hopefully they will release it in a few days so we
can get an idea of if this is even going to be possible to automatically
scan for at all with their tool.

Other than Coverity, I don't know of any other tool that is trying to
even identify this pattern :(

I thought gcc plugins were going to enable this type of analysis, or
maybe clang plugins, but I have yet to hear of anyone working on this.
