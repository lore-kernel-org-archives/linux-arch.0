I suspect this needs to be per-cpu, to account for heterogeneous
systems.

I guess if we move hcr_el2 into kvm_cpu_context, that gives us a
per-vcpu copy for guests, and a per-cpu copy for the host (in the global
kvm_host_cpu_state).

I'll have a look at how gnarly that turns out. I'm not sure how we can
initialise that sanely for the !VHE case to match whatever el2_setup
did.

Thanks,
Mark.
