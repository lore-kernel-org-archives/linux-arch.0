Rephrasing: the flag should always exist with the correct value.
Whether the kernel handles it or not, the kernel *headers* shouldn't
change to match the kernel, not least of which because they don't
necessarily match the running kernel.  Just like we define the
prototypes for syscalls that the running kernel may return ENOSYS for.

Not all systems care.  Otherwise you should be complaining more bitterly
about options like CONFIG_MMU=n, which (*gasp*) allow access to *arbitrary
memory*.

Hence why it has a config option.

The userspace option exists primarily because otherwise userspace might
get surprised by receiving a non-zeroed page.  On a system with the
config option turned on, processes have access to arbitrary freed
memory, as long as they say they can handle not having their memory
pre-zeroed.
