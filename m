No. LTP needs to pull in the latest changes from xfstests simply
because LTP is a conglomerate of domain specific tests. And it never
can become more than a conglomerate for obvious reasons.

xfstests is what the FS developers use and update. If LTP has some
extra magic tests developed then is should send patches against
xfstests and reintegrate the result.
