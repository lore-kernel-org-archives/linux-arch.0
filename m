Thank you for your valuable feedback! Maybe you have noticed that I
haven't enforced the patch and led others to decide the final name
(either by resubmitting patches or a simple replace in mmotm tree). Or
maybe you haven't because you are so busy bikesheding that you can
hardly see anything else.

You have surely saved the world today and I hardly find words to thank
you (and your dog of course).

Thanks!
