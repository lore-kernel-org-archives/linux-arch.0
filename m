There is. Previously when inc_not_zero() failed, you _knew_ it was 0 and
therefore know the object no longer 'exists'.

Similarly, if you know you're serialized against 1->0 you can then
assume it will not fail.

That goes out the window the moment you fail for any other condition.

I can well imagine code relying on the fact that failing to take a
reference means 0, see below. And once you start to fail for more
conditions, the actual value you failed on becomes interesting in order
to determine how to deal with it.

It is _NOT_ lying. It does as promised, it increments when it is not
zero. The fact that that increment can saturate is irrelevant. A
saturated reference is still a valid reference. Sure it causes a leak,
but who bloody cares, it shouldn't happen in the first place.

That is the 'feature', we get to have leaks. Also those leaks _should_
not happen. They are a result of 'broken' code. So I don't see how
exposing them to the wider world helps anything but spread the pain of
the failure.

Please explain how the below is not subtly broken by changing
inc_not_zero.

struct obj *__obj_lookup(key)
{
	obj = rcu_based_lookup(key);
	if (refcount_inc_not_zero(&obj->ref))
		return obj;

	return NULL;
}

struct obj *obj_find_acquire(key)
{
	/* fast path, lockless lookup */

	rcu_read_lock()
	obj = __obj_lookup(key);
	rcu_read_unlock();

	if (obj)
		return obj;

	/* slow path, serialize */

	lock(&obj_lock);
	/* we're serialized, if it exists we must get a ref */
	obj = __obj_lookup(key);
	if (obj)
		goto unlock;

	/* allocate a new object and insert it */
	obj = obj_alloc();
	obj_init(obj, key);

unlock:
	unlock(&obj_lock);

	return obj;
}

I very strongly disagree. The one thing this primitive does is change
add/sub to be saturating, *consistently*.

You argue to expose the failure case, leading to more error paths
leading to more complication. I'll argue that nobody wants more error
handling, esp. for something that should not happen to begin with.

refcount_t was never meant to be a drop-in replacement for atomic_t.
It is meant to be a fairly painless replacement for reference
counts that were previously implemented using atomic_t.

There is also the fairly common usage count scenario, that does not fit
well with refcount_t. I'm not sure we want to shoehorn that into
refcount_t either, we could create yet another type for that.

And there are of course a lot of less common things we're not wanting to
replace at all. atomic_t isn't broken we don't need to fix it.

I have no idea what you do so I cannot comment further.
