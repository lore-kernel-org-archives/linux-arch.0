It looks good except for:

I don't see an rwsem.h in powerpc anywhere?


And this is correct but a bit confusing:

>          irq-time-acct:  |  ok  |                           HAVE_IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING #  arch supports precise IRQ time accounting

I think you and Paul agreed it's "ok" on powerpc because we have
VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING instead, but that's not obvious.

Yep, so that's better than what we had, and we can always improve it.

cheers
