The partial behavior is very useful for protocols like HTTP1, since
the client can start processing the response if we send it down the
wire while we process other connections. It becomes even more useful
over HTTP2 which provides it's own framing where we can send a partial
response frame and move onto other requests in this connection or
other connections.
