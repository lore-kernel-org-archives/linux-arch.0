We want binaries that run fast on VSYSCALL kernels, but can fall back to
full system calls on kernels that do not have them (instead of
crashing).

We could parse the vDSO and prefer the functions found there, but this
is for the statically linked case.  We currently do not have a (minimal)
dynamic loader there in that version of the code base, so that doesn't
really work for us.

I know people do this for SIGILL to probe for CPU features, but yeah,
let's just not go there. 8-p

Thanks,
