Yeah, so I think the ideal approach would be if we emitted _both_ pieces of 
information:

     Mitigation: __user pointer sanitization
     Vulnerable: incomplete array index sanitization

I.e. we inform the user about the mitigation measures that are active, but we also 
fully inform that we think it's incomplete at this stage.

Yeah.
