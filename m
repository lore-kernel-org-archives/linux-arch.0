The three system calls won't return -ENOSYS on architectures which decided
to ignore them (like with with above mentioned commit), since they haven't
allocated a system call number at all.

Right now we have one architecture where these three system calls work if
the cpu supports the feature (x86).

Two architectures (arm, mips) have wired them up and thus allocated system
call numbers, even though they don't have ARCH_HAS_PKEYS set. Which seems a
bit pointless.

Three architectures (parisc, powerpc, s390) decided to ignore the system
calls completely, but still have the pkey code linked into the kernel
image.

imho the generic pkey code should be ifdef'ed with CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PKEYS.
Otherwise only dead code will be linked and increase the kernel image size
for no good reason.
