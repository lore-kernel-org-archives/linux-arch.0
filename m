Sounds good!

Is there any "problem" with applying these markings to code that could
be built as a module?  I'm thinking of lots of buses and drivers that
have structures like this, but can be a module or not, depending on the
configuration selected.  It would be nice to get the "benefit" of
protection if the code is built into the kernel image.
