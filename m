So, doing a worst-case timing of a loop of inc() to INT_MAX and then
dec_and_test() back to zero, I see this out of perf:

atomic
25255.114805      task-clock (msec)
 82249267387      cycles
 11208720041      instructions

refcount-fast
25259.577583      task-clock (msec)
 82211446892      cycles
 15486246572      instructions

refcount-full
44625.923432      task-clock (msec)
144814735193      cycles
105937495952      instructions

I'll still summarize all this in the v7 series, but I think that
really clarifies the differences: 1.5x more instructions in -fast, but
nearly identical cycles and clock. Using -full sees a large change (as
expected).
