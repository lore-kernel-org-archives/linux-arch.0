Well, the typical case is that it's a logic bug to _do_ the write: the structure 
was marked readonly for a reason but some init code re-runs during suspend or so.

But yes, logic bugs might trigger - but that is true in the opposite case as well, 
if we do the write despite it being marked readonly:

No, the difference to the GCC related aliasing bug is that with my technique the 
kernel would immediately produce a very visible kernel warning, which is a very 
clear sign that is wrong - and with a very clear backtrace in the warning that 
points right to the problematic code - which signature shows us (and users) what 
is wrong.

So your example is not comparable at all.

Plus the truly paranoid might panic/halt the system on such warnings, so for 
highly secure systems there's a way to not even allow the possibility of logic 
bugs. (at the cost of stopping the system when a bug triggers.)

Thanks,

	Ingo
