It was I who got linux-arch established, so I'm fairly familiar with
it.  (12 years ago, gad).

I don't think it's been very successful, particularly for this purpose.
A whole pile of randomly cc'ed lkml overflow which we're relying on each
individual maintainer to sift through and pluck out particular action
items then later remember to implement them.  It's disorganized and has
too many cracks for things to fall through.
