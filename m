Of course, and everything about the technical feedback and suggestions
was completely valid, on point, and made the patches that much better.
What wasn't appreciated and what I am tired of grinning and bearing is
the idea that it's only the maintainer that can show emotion, that
it's only the maintainer that can be exasperated and burnt out.

For example, I would have spun v6 the same day (same hour?) had the
mail started, "hey I'm late to the party, why aren't all these helpers
in a new _nospec namespace?". I might have pointed to the mails from
Peter about ifence being his preferred name for a speculation barrier
and Alexei's request to drop nospec [1] and moved on because naming is
a maintainer's prerogative.

Care is a two way street. I respect yours and Ingo's workload, please
respect mine.
