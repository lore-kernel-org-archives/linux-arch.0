I think we should strive to do that on the kernel side too, since
clearly we shouldn't expose that "val[]" thing in the core posix types
due to namespace rules, but at the same time I think the patch to
rename val[] is fundamentally broken too.

Can you describe how you split things (perhaps even with a patch ;)?
Is this literally the only issue you currently have? Because I'd
expect similar issues to show up elsewhere too, but who knows.. You
presumably do.
