No, it changes the tag associated with the virtual address for the 
caller. Physical page backing this virtual address is unaffected. Tag 
checking is done for virtual addresses. The one restriction where 
physical address is relevant is when two processes map the same physical 
page, they both have to use the same tag for the virtual addresses that 
map on to the shared physical pages.

Are you concerned about DoS even if the tag is associated with virtual 
address, not physical address?
