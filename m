Oh, if that's an option, that would be great, I think.


But this means, for example, that a non-root, non-dumpable process can't
open /proc/self/maps anymore, or open /proc/self/fd/*, and things like
that, without making itself dumpable. I would be surprised if there is
no code out there that relies on that.

From what I can tell, without the introspection special case,
introspection would fail in the following cases (assuming that the
process is not capable and isn't using sys_setfs[ug]id()):

 - ruid/euid/suid are not all the same
 - rgid/egid/sgid are not all the same
 - process is not dumpable

I think that there probably should be some way for a non-dumpable
process to look at its own procfs entries? If we could start from a
clean slate, I'd propose an opt-in flag to openat() for that, but
since we don't have a clean slate, I'd be afraid of breaking things
with that. But maybe I'm just being overly careful here?
