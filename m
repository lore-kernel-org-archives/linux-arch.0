So if I may put my user space hat on. I maintain a container runtime LXC
and Aleksa maintains runC another container runtime. We both have
(horrible) code in our respective projects that tries to ensure that a
given path doesn't escape a given dirfd. Symlink resolution, and then
using crazy things such as mounting through /proc/<pid>/fd/<nr> etc. pp.
It works and we have been living with this state for a long time. But we
would both definitely use this feature. We've been discussing this and
had this on our wishlist for quite a long time and it would be good to
have this patchset.
Aside from that I want to point out that it is non-trivial to do this in
user space. The original code for restricted path resolution in our
codebase was done and is maintained by people like Serge and myself who
are involved in kernel development and it honestly required some pretty
intricate knowledge. I think having this feature work out of the box in
the kernel is a great win for quite a lot projects. Definitely for LXC
and runC.
