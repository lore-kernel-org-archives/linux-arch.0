Sorry, but I don't have a good picture how we are supposed
to use that. I'm fine with two syscalls, but I need a way to
tell the kernel to either block or not. Or do you want Samba
to do repeated pread calls for ever shorter blocks? Right
now I don't see a way to tell pread to either give me a
short result or really block. To me that's the core of
preadv2. I'm perfectly find for a syscall to give me a short
read instead of a global EWOULDBLOCK. I need a way to tell
the kernel which behaviour I want.
