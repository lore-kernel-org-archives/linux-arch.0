Eh? The splitting will occur at the C ABI level, not as a result of
glibc (though, it could be done that way if you really wanted, but then
you're just moving the wrapper up the chain.)

A 64-bit value on a 32-bit machine will look like, in a register pair,
like it looks in memory, with MSB/LSB ordering.

Sadly this isn't possible without a wrapper unless you can guarantee
it was passed low high instead of high low. Unless you munge it in
userspace, you can't.
