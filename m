Can=E2=80=99t an ELF note be done with some more or less ordinary asm such t=

The problem with a personality flag is that it needs to have some kind of se=
nsible behavior for setuid programs, and getting that right in a way that do=
esn=E2=80=99t scream =E2=80=9Cexploit me=E2=80=9D while preserving useful co=
mpatibility may be tricky.=
