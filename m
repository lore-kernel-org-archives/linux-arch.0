I think this is a good idea in general, but it is likely to cause a lot of
new warnings. Especially the -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings get
new false positives every time we get substantially different inlining
decisions.

I've added your patch to my randconfig test setup and will let you
know if I see anything noticeable. I'm currently testing clang-arm32,
clang-arm64 and gcc-x86.
