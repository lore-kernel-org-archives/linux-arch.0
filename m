I'm worried that this causes interop issues similarly to what we see
with VSYSCALL today.  If we need both and a way to disable it, it should
be something like a personality flag which can be configured for each
process tree separately.  Ideally, we'd settle on one correct approach
(i.e., either always process both, or only process PT_GNU_PROPERTY) and
enforce that.
