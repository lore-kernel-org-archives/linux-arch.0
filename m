 I think we ought to do both.

 First, we have our own FP emulation code, which is changed from time to 
time, that uses the same exit path that the hardware exception does.  It 
could happen that we miss something and return SIGFPE from the emulation 
code without setting the cause bits appropriately.  This would be our own 
bug which might trigger exceedingly rarely and could then be caught by 
WARN_ON_ONCE or otherwise stay there forever in the absence of that check.

 Second, changing `si_code' from __SI_FAULT to 0 aka __SI_KILL will likely 
interfere with `copy_siginfo_to_user32' in arch/mips/kernel/signal32.c, 
making the userland lose the address of the faulting instruction in 32-bit 
software run on 64-bit hardware only, making our API inconsistent.  Using 
a distinct `si_code' value such as FPE_IMPOSSIBLE (though we might choose 
say FPE_FLTUNK for "FLoaTing point UNKnown" instead, for consistency; mind 
that most `si_code' macros have the same number of characters within 
groups associated with individual signals) for such odd traps is allowed 
by SUS and will prevent the inconsistency from happening, very cheaply as 
you say.
