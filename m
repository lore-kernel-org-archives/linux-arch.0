Well, yes, but that's kind of my point. Detecting inc-from-0 is "too
late" to offer a protection. It offers notification of a bug, rather
than stopping an exploit from happening.

Right, both are bugs, but the exploitable condition is "refcount hit
zero and got freed while there were still things using it". Having too
many put()s that cause the refcount to reach zero early can't be
detected, but having too many get()s that wrap around, ultimately to
zero, can be (the overflow condition). With overflow protection, the
refcount can never (realistically) hit zero since the refcount will
get saturated at INT_MAX, so no exploit is possible -- no memory is
ever freed (it just leaks the allocation). The inc-from-zero case
performing a notification is certainly nice, but the exploit already
happened.

I want the overflow protection to work everywhere the kernel uses
refcounts, which means dealing with performance concerns from mm, net,
block, etc. Since this is a 1 instruction change (which branch
prediction should make almost no cost at all), this will easily
address any performance concerns from the other subsystems.

I'd rather have the overflow protection everywhere than only in some
areas, and I want to break the deadlock of this catch-22 of subsystems
not being able to say what benchmarks are important to them but
refusing to switch to refcount_t due to performance concerns.
