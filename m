I very much like the short read behavior. It lets you overlap some CPU
work partial data (like TLS and then sticking it network output
buffer) with waiting for the test of the data (enequed in the thread
pool).

Short reads are the current behavior, if you call preadv2 a second
time around at EOF it'll return 0 instead of EWOULDBLOCK today. I
actually test for this in the preadv2 test in xfstest here:
https://github.com/mtanski/xfstests/commit/688db24c292999c81ee17caf2b61fe8cf7bb3cd6#diff-114416ea98ce29dde3b5b3d145afbd2bR81.

There's one caveat, that it's possible to get EWOULDBLOCK when reading
at end of file if the file metadata is not paged in.
