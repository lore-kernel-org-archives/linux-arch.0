Volker and did wired so we can use Samba as a test / use case. The
change we made was quick and dirty 9 lines of code, if you exclude the
syscall boiler plate. In fact, right now it does the stupid thing of
throwing away the partial result and enqueing in the threadpool if it
doesn't get the whole block. Volker agreed that was as much as we need
to do to get the numbers and we'll make a proper patch once it's in
upstream.

Patch to samba at end of email for reference.

You're right. I will fix this.
