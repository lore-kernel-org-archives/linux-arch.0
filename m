for worst case analysis you need to show the existence of an amd64 system that
can spawn 2G tasks. then you'll have to show the feasibility of making all of
them get preempted (without a later reschedule) inside a 2 insn window.

are there any other 0 checks in there?

you only said the same thing, what 0 means. you (still) didn't explain how
checking for it prevents exploitation.

sure, so far so good.

why would ever be there such an attempt? a freed object with intact memory
content is as useful for an attacker as a live one, that is, not at all.
