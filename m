Music to my ears - although TBH there's probably two opposing forces: advantages 
from the cache versus (possibly very minor, if measurable at all) disadvantages 
from the 4K granularity.

So I'd prefer the following approach: to apply it to a v4.8-rc1 base in ~2 weeks 
and keep it default-y for much of the next development cycle. If no serious 
problems are found in those ~2 months then send it to Linus in that fashion. We 
can still turn it off by default (or re-spin the whole approach) if it turns out 
to be too risky.

Exposing it as default-n for even a small amount of time will massively reduce the 
testing we'll get, as most people will just use the N setting (often without 
noticing).

Plus this also gives net-next and other preparatory patches applied directly to 
maintainer trees time to trickle upstream.

Thanks,
