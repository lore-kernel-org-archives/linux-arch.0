That's of little use to people trying to understand the git commit.

And it's of little use to people who write the documentation. 
Hopefully Michael has been following this closely enough to get by with
what we have here (ie: nothing).

And it's of little use to people who are trying to review this patch
and who haven't followed this alleged lengthy discussion. (ie: me)

And it's of little use to people who write for sites such as lwn.net,
http://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges etc.

This is not some personal weekend hack project.  It is the Linux
kernel, used by millions around the world.

OK, that covered a lot of architectures.
