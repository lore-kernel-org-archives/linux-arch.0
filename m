Kees original patch was about moving the vector pages into the
read-only area after init, so the linear mapping of them becomes
read-only as well.  So that won't work.  We need at least one
read-write mapping for FIQ, and for context switching for kuser
helpers.

We could probably predicate moving the vectors page into the RO
section when kuser helpers are enabled.

I believe Android already disable kuser helpers as of a few years ago.
