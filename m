What we *SHOULD* be doing is to *HAVE ABIS RULE AND STICK TO THEM*.
Which is that on architectures that need a padding register, we add the
padding register on those architectures, and if they need stubs, then we
add stubs -- preferrably by automation (c.f. my automation scripts for
doing exactly that.)

What we *SHOULDN'T DO* is hand-craft the ABI of every system call to
avoid the rules we happen to have already set for ourselves.  If the
rules are too inflexible, they should be sanitized, not worked around.

The sheer number of system calls with weird exceptions to the ABI is a
total mess, and for absolutely no good reason.  All it means is an
exception which last forever, because no amount of automation in the
world can fix it once it is in.
