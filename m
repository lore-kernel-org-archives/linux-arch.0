I didn't realized this was the main use case for AT_BENEATH. Landlock is
indeed dedicated to apply a security policy on a set of processes. This
set can be a process and its children (seccomp-like), or another set of
processes that may be identified with a cgroup.

Another way to apply a security policy could be to tied it to a file
descriptor, similarly to Capsicum, which could enable to create
programmable (real) capabilities. This way, it would be possible to
"wrap" a file descriptor with a Landlock program and use it with
FD-based syscalls or pass it to other processes. This would not require
changes to the FS subsystem, but only the Landlock LSM code. This isn't
done yet but I plan to add this new way to restrict operations on file
descriptors.

Anyway, for the use case you mentioned, the AT_BENEATH flag(s) should be
simple to use and enough for now. We must be careful of the hardcoded
policy though.
