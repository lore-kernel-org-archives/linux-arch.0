I was imagining a completely separate area in memory for supervisor states. =
 I guess this might defeat the modified optimization and is probably a bad i=

Do we need to have TIF_LOAD_FPU mean =E2=80=9Cwe need to load *some* of the x=
save state=E2=80=9D?  If so, maybe a bunch of the accessors should have thei=
r interfaces reviewed to make sure they=E2=80=99re sill sensible.

Indeed.  But, if we document a taxonomy of states, we should make sure it fi=
ts in. I guess it=E2=80=99s like supervisor CET except that user code can ca=
n also read and write it.

We should probably have self tests that make sure that the correct states, a=
nd nothing else, show up in ptrace and signal states, and that trying to wri=
te supervisor CET via ptrace and sigreturn is properly rejected.

Just to double check my mental model: it=E2=80=99s okay to XSAVES twice to t=
he same buffer with disjoint RFBM as long as we do something intelligent wit=
h XSTATE_BV afterwards, right?  Because, unless we split up the buffers, I t=
hink we will have to do this when we context switch while TIF_LOAD_FPU is se=
t.

Are there performance numbers for how the time needed to XRSTORS everything v=
ersus the time to XRSTORS supervisor CET and then separately XRSTORS the FPU=
?  This may affect whether we want context switches to have the new task eag=
erly or lazily restored.

Hmm. I wonder if we need some way for a selftest to reliably trigger TIF_LOA=
D_FPU.
