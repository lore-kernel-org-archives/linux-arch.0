Yes, but at least for the cases I can think of, that's probably a good
thing.  OTOH, I can see cases where you want everyone to be able to
read but only specific code paths to be able to write.

I think it's more or less impossible to get sensible behavior passing
pkey != 0 data to legacy functions.  If you call:

void frob(struct foo *p);

If frob in turn passes p to a thread, what PKRU is it supposed to use?

We could try to insist that user code uses some vsyscall helper that
tracks which bits are as-yet-unassigned.  That's quite messy, though.

We could also arbitrarily partition the key space into
initially-wide-open, initially-read-only, and initially-no-access and
let pkey_alloc say which kind it wants.
