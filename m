The address will be in between the user and kernel address ranges, so
it's guaranteed to be invalid and not address any memory.

Specifically, assuming a 48-bit VA configuration, user addresses must
have bits [55:48] clear and kernel addresses must have bits [63:48] set.
When authentication fails it will set two bits in those ranges to "10"
or "01", ensuring that the address is no longer a valid user or kernel
address.

Sounds reasonable to me, I'll add a warning.

Thanks,
