We're trying to prevent a pointer under user control from being
de-referenced inside the kernel, before we know it has been limited to
something safe. In the following sequence the branch we are worried
about speculating is the privilege check:

if (access_ok(uptr))  /* <--- Privelege Check */
    if (copy_from_user_(uptr))

The cpu can speculatively skip that access_ok() check and cause a read
of kernel memory.
