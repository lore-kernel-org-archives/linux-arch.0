From my reading of the code, pread2() will return -EAGAIN only when it
copied zero bytes to userspace.  ie, the very first page wasn't in
cache.  If pread2() does copy some data to userspace then it will
return the amount of data copied.  This is traditional read()
behaviour.

Maybe there's some other code somewhere in the patch which converts
that short read into -EAGAIN, dunno - the changelogs don't appear to
mention it and the manpage update is ambiguous about this.

But from an interface perspective the behaviour you're asking for is
insane, frankly - if the kernel copied out 8k of data then pread2()
should return 8k.  Otherwise there's no way for userspace to know that
the 8k copy actually happened and we have just wasted a great pile of
CPU doing a pointless memcpy.

I expect that this situation (first part in cache, latter part not in
cache) is rare - for reasonably small requests the common cases will be
"all cached" and "nothing cached".  So perhaps the best approach here
is for samba to add special handling for the short read, to work out
the reason for its occurrence.

Alternatively we could add another flag to pread2() to select this
"throw away my data and return -EAGAIN" behaviour.  Presumably
implemented with an i_size check, but it's gonna be racy.



I take it from your comments that nobody has actually wired up pread2()
into samba yet?  That's a bit disturbing, because if we later want to
go and change something like this short-read behaviour, we're screwed -
it's a non back-compat userspace-visible change.


And a note on cosmetics: why are we using EAGAIN here rather than
EWOULDBLOCK?  They have the same numerical value, but EWOULDBLOCK is a
better name - EAGAIN says "run it again", but that won't work.
