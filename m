It fixes the alignment issue but still won't work; on MIPS 32-bit userspace
will pass the 64-bit argument in two registers but the 64-bit kernel code
will assume it to be passed in a single registers.  It'd be ugly but passing
a pointer to a 64-bit argument would solve the issue; something like this:

sys_preadv(unsigned long fd, const struct iovec __user *vec,
                  unsigned long vlen, loff_t __user *pos);
compat_sys_preadv(unsigned long fd, const struct compat_iovec __user *vec,
                  unsigned long vlen, loff_t __user *pos);

sys_splice uses loff_t __user * arguments as well and that's why it's
doesn't need any compat wrapper.

I'm surprised this works for x86; does x86-64 code really expect 64-bit
arguments as 2 32-bit arguments?

Patch 1/3 looks like it's a bug fix and you may want to submit this
separate from the remainder of the series for 2.6.28?
