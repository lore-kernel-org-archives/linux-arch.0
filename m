No, it's literally a corectness issue.

If you do

	offset = ((loff_t) high) << BITS_IN_LONG;

then that is literally undefined behavior in C (if "loff_t" and "long" are 
the same size), and a lot of C compilers will end up just optimizing it 
away entirely.

Even if they don't optimize it away, and if they actually generate the 
instruction for it, architectures will not actually do what you think they 
do. At least on x86, shift counts are fundamentally limited to the low 
bits, so if you do 

	movl $64,%ecx
	shlq %ecx,reg

then an x86 will literally shift 'reg' by _zero_, because the count is 
masked by 6 bits (or 5, in the 32-bit case).

So literally, if gcc were to generate the obvious (stupid) code, it would 
give the wrong value.

With the double shift, we have well-defined behavior.

Ok, a few more ack's, and I can commit it. Anybody disagree?
