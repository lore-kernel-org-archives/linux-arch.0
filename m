Pretty nice!

Could you please also create a tabulated quick-comparison of the three variants, 
of all key properties, about behavior, feature and tradeoff differences?

Something like:

				!ARCH_HAS_REFCOUNT	ARCH_HAS_REFCOUNT=y	REFCOUNT_FULL=y

avg fast path instructions:	5			3			10
behavior on overflow:		unsafe, silent		safe,   verbose		safe,   verbose
behavior on underflow:		unsafe, silent		unsafe, verbose		unsafe, verbose
...

etc. - note that this table is just a quick mockup with wild guesses. (Please add 
more comparisons of other aspects as well.)

Such a comparison would make it easier for arch, subsystem and distribution 
maintainers to decide on which variant to use/enable.

Thanks,

	Ingo
