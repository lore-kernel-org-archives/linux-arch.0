No.

Are you saying that I should push them through glibc first - and then submit
them to the kernel?  Does the kernel lead or the C library?  And, if the
latter, which C library?  Can I not, for instance, push them through uclibc,
say?

Does submitting to glibc mean I have to sign my copyrights over to the FSF for
that code?  I've never gone through this process.
