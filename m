This regression fix still hasn't been merged into Linus' tree.  What is
going on here?

This might seem rather minor, but the namespace testing is actually
relevant in practice.  It prevents accidental clashes with C/C++
identifiers in user code.

If this fairly central UAPI header is not made namespace-clean again,
then we need to duplicate information from more UAPI headers in glibc,
and I don't think that's something we'd want to do.

Thanks,
Florian
