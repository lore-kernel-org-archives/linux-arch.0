From the last paragraph of this guidance:

https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/c5/63/336996-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channel-Mitigations.pdf

...I read that as Linux can constrain speculation with 'and; sbb'
instead of 'lfence', and any future changes will be handled like any
new cpu enabling.

To your specific question of the relative costs, sbb is
architecturally cheaper, so let's go with that approach.

For this '__uaccess_begin_nospec' patch set, at a minimum the kernel
needs a helper that can be easily grep'd when/if it needs changing in
a future kernel. It also indicates that the command line approach to
dynamically switch the mitigation mechanism is over-engineering.

That said, for get_user specifically, can we do something even
cheaper. Dave H. reminds me that any valid user pointer that gets past
the address limit check will have the high bit clear. So instead of
calculating a mask, just unconditionally clear the high bit. It seems
worse case userspace can speculatively leak something that's already
in its address space.

I'll respin this set along those lines, and drop the ifence bits.
