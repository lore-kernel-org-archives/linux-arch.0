Sure, but this means you allocate index 1 once and then use it in both
threads.  If you allocate separately in each thread, nothing
guarantees you'll get the same index both times, and if you don't then
the code doesn't work.

That how I think I would think of them, but for this to be fully safe,
we'd want to lock them down in signal handlers by default, which is
what I'm suggesting.
