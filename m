I don't have a strong opinion on that -- I had preferred not to add a
document describing stuff that doesn't exist at the time of commit.
I could commit a stub document at the start of the series, and then
commit the real document later.

Either way, it seemed overkill.

Perhaps I should have drawn more attention to the documentation in the
cover letter, and encouraged reviewers to look at it first.  My
experience is that people don't often read cover letters...

Now the series is posted, I'm minded to keep the order as-is, unless you
think it's a big issue.

Adding a reference to the document seems a reasonable thing to do,
so I could add that.

I was trying to keep extraneous #defines to a minimum, since this is a
uapi header, and people may depend on anything defined here.

I think SVE_VQ_BYTES is reasonable to have, and this allows us to
rewrite a few hard-coded 0x10s and 16s symbolically which is probably a
good idea -- I'll add this.

SVE_VQ_BITS looks redundant to me though.  It wouldn't be used for any
purpose other than defining SVE_VQ_BYTES.
