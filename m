And, as an aside for anyone curious, I've just added this to my .vimrc:

" Enable spell checking in Kconfig files
autocmd BufEnter Kconfig* set spell
" Enable spell checking in git commit edits
autocmd BufEnter COMMIT_EDITMSG set spell

I'm always forgetting to double-check the spellchecker mode, and in
those files, it should just be enabled by default. :P

Yeah, this is much clearer, thanks! I've replaced this for v8.

I've got a qemu image for 32-bit too. Behavior and timing are
similarly matched. I've got updates to LKDTM that provide test
coverage of the refcount API. (I was going to send that via the
drivers tree, with some other LKDTM updates.) If you want to see it, a
not-quite-final version is here:

I've rewritten this now; hopefully it will be easier to parse.

My understanding was that using numbered labels allows us to have
repeated labels in the same function. (i.e. NUMb and NUMf can't, I
think, be done with text labels.)

True! I'll fix this (and the "OF flag" usage above there).

Yes, I agonized over this because I hated the look of each variation I
tried here. I'll try again. :)

Thanks for the review!
