Unfortunatelly doing this as an extension wouldn't work due to backward
compatibility issues. See [1]

I am not really sure but Michael has pointed out to jemalloc [2] which
could probably use it.

How do you do something like that safely in a multithreaded environment?
You do not have any safe way to do atomic probe of a memory range.

As I've said, I do not insist on exporting this functionality to the
userspace. I can make it an internal flag (outside of the map type) and
use it solely in the kernel but considering how MAP_FIXED is tricky I
wouldn't be surprised if the userspace can find a use for this. The main
question is, are there any downsides to do so?
