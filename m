'struct rusage' contains the run times of a process in 'timeval' format
and is accessed through the wait4() and getrusage() system calls. This
is not a problem for y2038 safety by itself, but causes an issue when
the C library starts using 64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures because
the structure layout becomes incompatible.

There are three possible ways of dealing with this:

a) deprecate the wait4() and getrusage() system calls, and create
   a set of kernel interfaces based around a newly defined structure that
   could solve multiple problems at once, e.g. provide more fine-grained
   timestamps. The C library could then implement the posix interfaces
   on top of the new system calls.

b) Extend the approach taken by the x32 ABI, and use the 64-bit
   native structure layout for rusage on all architectures with new
   system calls that is otherwise compatible. A downside of this
   is that it requires a number of ugly hacks to deal with all the
   other fields of the structure also becoming 64 bit wide.
   Especially on big-endian architectures, we can't easily use the
   union trick from glibc.

c) Change the definition of struct rusage to be independent of
   time_t. This is the easiest change, as it does not involve new system
   call entry points, but it requires the C library to convert between
   the kernel format of the structure and the user space definition.

d) Add a new ABI variant of 'struct rusage' that corresponds to the
   current layout with 32-bit counters but 64-bit time_t. This would
   minimize the libc changes but require additional kernel code to
   handle a third binary layout on 64-bit kernels.

I'm picking approach c) for its simplicity. As pointed out by reviewers,
simply using the kernel structure in user space would not be POSIX
compliant, but I have verified that none of the usual C libraries (glibc,
musl, uclibc-ng, newlib) do that. Instead, they all provide their own
definition of 'struct rusage' to applications in sys/resource.h.

To be on the safe side, I'm only changing the definition inside of
the kernel and for user space with an updated 'time_t'. All existing
users will see the traditional layout that is compatible with what the
C libraries export. A 32-bit application that includes linux/resource.h
but uses an update C library with 64-bit time_t will now see the low-level
kernel structure that corresponds to the getrusage() system call interface
but that will be different from one defined in sys/resource.h for the
getrusage library interface.
