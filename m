Hmm. This will break any script that does echo foo >/dev/stdin too.

Just to throw an idea out there, what if the open were allowed if the file m=
ode is sufficient or if the magic link target is openable with the correct m=
ode without magic?  In other words, first check as in your code but without t=
he exception and, if that check fails, then walk the same path that d_path w=
ould return and see if it would work as a normal open?  Of course, that seco=
nd attempt would need to disable magic links to avoid recursing.  I=E2=80=99=
m not sure I love this idea...

Otherwise, I imagine we can live with the exception, especially if the new o=
pen API turns it off by default.
