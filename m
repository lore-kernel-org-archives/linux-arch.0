A pointer would help.

I would say that different argument order in strace is a lot better than
having an argument completely mangled, which is what one gets with this
as proposed.

All in all, I think it is WRONG to make sane architectures suffer for
what broken architectures have to do, and we should implement this the
sane way without any shuffling, splitting, or other braindamage.
