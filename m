$ grep "Killed process \<103[168]\>" kern5.log
$

So none of the sleeping tasks has been killed previously.

OK, I am really confused now. The log contains a lot of in-kernel memcg
oom killer messages:
$ grep "Memory cgroup out of memory:" kern5.log | wc -l
809

This suggests that the oom killer is not disabled. What exactly has you
script done?

There is an oom killer striking at 11:05:35:

And this doesn't list any of the tasks sleeping and waiting for oom
resolving so they must have been created after this OOM. Is this the
same group?
