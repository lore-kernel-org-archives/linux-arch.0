Well it was my assumption that samba would be able to do something
useful with a partial read - pread() is allowed to return less than requested.

If it isn't the case that samba can use the partial read result then
what does it do?  It has to save the partial data, then do the
additional IO?  That's pretty clunky compared to

	if (it's all in cache)
		read it all now
	else
		ask a worker thread to read it all

Bear in mind that these operations involve physical IO and large
memcpy's.  Yes, a fincore() approach will consume more CPU but the
additional overhead will be relatively small.

Tradeoffs are involved, and it may turn out that choosing a more
flexible and powerful interface which is somewhat more CPU intensive is
a better decision.  It's hard to say until this is quantified (ie:
measured).

It won't be guaranteed that the fincore()+pread() will be
non-blocking.  But blocking will be very rare.  I don't know whether
the additional expense of activating the pages within fincore() is
justified - needs runtime testing.
