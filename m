I=E2=80=99m wondering if we can still do it: add a note or other ELF indicat=
or that says =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t need vsyscalls.=E2=80=9D  Then we can c=
hange the default mode to =E2=80=9Cno vsyscalls if the flag is there, else e=
xecute-only vsyscalls=E2=80=9D.

Would glibc go along with this?  Would enterprise distros consider backporti=
ng such a thing?
