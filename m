The section relevant in the SDM is 43.2.6 but I started to think that
why in dumbed down return-to-AEP that would even be a problem? If you
are single step debugging isn't that what you want? Continue single
stepping in the AEP handler...

I still don't understand the part where the need for decoding
instruction stream comes in this dumbed down approach. There's
not RIP manipulation or anything involved at all.

With this reconsideration I would keep this as one option at least.
