I would /love/ to get rid of mmiowb() because I think it's both extremely
difficult to use and also pretty much never needed. It reminds me a lot of
smp_read_barrier_depends(), which we finally pushed into READ_ONCE for
Alpha.

I thought ia64 was the hold out here? Did they actually have machines that
needed this in practice? If so, I think we can either:

  (a) Add an mmiowb() to their spin_unlock() code, or
  (b) Remove ia64 altogether if nobody complains

I know that Peter has been in favour of (b) for a while...
