There are some trivial conflicts with one or two patches that already
went into arm64/for-next/core, so I based on that for this posting, not
torvalds/master.

There's a note in the cover letter giving the precise commit I based
on, though the branch doesn't seem to have moved yet since I posted.

Otherwise, I don't see any conflict -- can you give details?

Cheers
