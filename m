How do you intend to find 'current' to get to the preempt count
without first disabling preemption?

In principal, yes, but could you alternatively put it in
thread_struct?  My goal here is to encourage people to clean up their
use of thread_info vs thread_struct at the same time.  For x86, that
cleanup was trivial -- most of the work was addressing relative to
current instead of the stack pointer, and that had to happen
regardless.
