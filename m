No, this is not the case. Maybe my whole understanding of
pread is wrong: I always thought that it won't return short
if the file spans the pread range. EINTR nonwithstanding.

I know I'm repeating myself: We have a race condition here.
A small one, but it is racy. I've seen loaded systems where
we spend seconds between becoming re-scheduled. In these
systems, it will be the norm to block in later reads. And we
don't have a good way to detect this situation afterwards
and turn to threads as a precaution next time.

We have to pay this price for every single chunk. Without
oplocks we get 10-byte read requests. This is hard to
swallow for many vendors with small CPUs.
