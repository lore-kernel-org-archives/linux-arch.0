I agree, that something needs to be said. What I instead did was=20
added "See BUGS" to the ENOEXEC error, and then this text:

   BUGS
       The  ENOENT  error  described above means that it is not possibl=
e
       possible to set the close-on-exec flag  on  the  file  descripto=
r
       given to a call of the form:

           execveat(fd, "", argv, envp, AT_EMPTY_PATH);

       However, the inability to set the close-on-exec flag means that =
a
       file descriptor referring to the  script  leaks  through  to  th=
e
       script  itself.  As well as wasting a file descriptor, this leak=
=E2=80=90
       age can lead to file-descriptor  exhaustion  in  scenarios  wher=
e
       scripts  recursively  employ  exceveat()  (or a future fexecve(3=
)
       implementation that might be based on execveat()).

Okay?

Thanks,

Michael
