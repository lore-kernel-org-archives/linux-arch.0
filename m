So maybe we should think about doing this recovery as part of oops
processing.  That is, we oops as usual, but rather than killing the
task or spinning, we allow the post-oops code to try to recover (if
enabled).  That recovery step decodes the instruction and takes some
action.  In this example, if it's a write to ro-after-init memory,
then maybe we un-write-protect it and resume.

I agree with Linus' old sentiment as least insofar as trying to decode
things pre-OOPS is a bad idea: we don't want that decoding to
interfere with our primary goal, which is printing the OOPS.

I would argue that, if this is okay, we do exactly the same thing for
failed msr access.  We still oops, but we try to march on.

We could consider a default setting in which we "recover" from oops
until init starts and then we revert to old behavior (oopses kill the
task).
