True, we could simplify it to just sanitize the index with the
expectation that speculating with index 0 is safe. Although we'd want
to document it just case there is some odd code paths where the valid
portion of the array is offset from 0.

I like this approach better because it handles cases where the bounds
check is far away from the array de-reference. I.e. instead of having
array_ptr() and array_idx() for different cases, just sanitize the
index.

The goal is to prevent the compiler from emitting conditional
instructions. For example, the simplest form of this sanitize
operation from Adam:

    return 0 - ((long) (idx < sz));

...produces the desired "cmp, sbb" sequence on x86, but leads to a
"csel" instruction being emitted for arm64.

Stepping back and realizing that all this churn is around the
un-optimized form of the comparison vs the inline asm that an arch can
provide, and we're effectively handling the carry bit in software, we
can have a WARN_ON_ONCE(idx < 0 || sz < 0) to catch places where the
expectations of the macro are violated.

Archs can remove the overhead of that extra branch with an instruction
sequence to handle the carry bit in hardware, otherwise we get runtime
coverage of places where array_idx() gets used incorrectly.

Yes, I'll add some BUILD_BUG_ON safety for cases where sizeof(idx) >
sizeof(long).

Thanks for taking a look.
